  <p class="noindent">
    <span class="smcap">Abundant</span> as is the mass of material for the
    study of history and manners in the sixteenth
    century,<a id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
    there is even a greater abundance
    for the history, political and social, of the century of the Stuarts.
    There are, however, two difficulties to be faced in such an inquiry.
    The first is that the history of London is far more closely connected
    with the history of the nation during the seventeenth than during the
    sixteenth century. It may, indeed, be advanced that at no time, not
    even when London deposed Richard II. and set up Henry IV., was the City
    so closely involved in all the events of the time as in the seventeenth
    century. The City at that time reached the highest point of its
    political importance, an importance which vanished in the century that
    followed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Therefore the historian of London has before him the broad fact that
    for sixty years, viz. from the accession of Charles I. to the expulsion
    of James II., he should be pursuing the history of the country. In
    this place, however, there is not space for such a history; it has
    already been well told by many historians; and I have neither the time
    nor the competence to write the history of this most eventful period.
    I have therefore found it necessary to assume a certain knowledge
    of events and to speak of their sequence with reference especially
    to the attitude of the City; the forces which acted on the people;
    their ideas; their resolution and tenacity under Charles I.; their
    servility and obedience under Charles II.; and their final rejection
    of the doctrines of passive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
    resistance, Divine right, and obedience
    which made the departure of James possible, and opened the door for
    constitutional government and the liberties of the people.
  </p>

  <p>
    The second difficulty is, that while the century contains an
    immense mass of material in the shape of plays, poems, fiction,
    pamphlets, sermons, travels, sketches, biographies, trials, reports,
    proclamations, ordinances, speeches, and every other conceivable
    document for the restoration of the century, the period was sharply
    divided into two by the Civil Wars and the Protectorate, the latter
    being at best a stop-gap, while events were following each other and
    the mind of the nation was developing. It was, in fact, a revolutionary
    change which took place. The change was deepened by the Great Fire of
    1666, after which a new London arose, not so picturesque, perhaps,
    as the former London, but reflecting the ideas of the time in its
    churches, which, from Mass houses became preaching rooms; and in
    its houses, which offered substantial comfort, more light, loftier
    rooms, standing in wider and better ordered streets, agreeing with
    the increase of wealth and the improvement in the general conditions
    of life. The first half of the century is, in fact, a continuation of
    the Elizabethan period with decay in literature and development in
    religion; the second half belongs to the eighteenth century, where we
    find a development of the last forty years of the seventeenth.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have endeavoured to meet this difficulty by making such a selection
    from the things belonging to the daily life as have not been dwelt upon
    in the study of the sixteenth century with those points which, while
    they were developed or dropped in the eighteenth, have not been in that
    volume considered at length.
  </p>

  <p>
    The events of the greatest importance to the City, apart from those
    which belong to the whole nation, were the repeated visitations of
    Plague, and the Great Fire. The former came and went; it destroyed
    the people, chiefly the common people, by thousands; its immediate
    effect was a dearth of craftsmen and servants, a rise in wages, and an
    improvement in the standard of life in the lower levels. The lessons
    which it taught and continually enforced were learned most imperfectly.
    They were simple—the admission into the courts and lanes of the crowded
    City of light and air; the invention of some system of
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">vii</span> sanitation
    which would replace the old cesspool and the public latrine; and the
    introduction of a plentiful supply of water for the washing of the
    people, as well as for their drink and for the flooding of the streets.
    Somewhere or other—it must be between Dowgate and Mincing Lane—there is
    still existing under ground the great Roman Cloaca; it is an additional
    proof of the desertion and desolation of the City after the Romans went
    away that the Cloaca was forgotten, choked up, and its mouth covered
    over; the creation of the foreshore covered it up. Had it been found,
    say, in the thirteenth or fourteenth century, the whole modern sanitary
    system might have been invented and developed by its means, and so the
    Plague would have been stayed. I have attempted to present an adequate
    account of the Plague from contemporary evidence. As regards the Fire I
    have essayed a restoration of the City before and after that event.
  </p>

  <p>
    Turning to events political, I have already stated the difficulties
    which confront the historian of London in this century. The reader
    will not look here for a detailed history of the Civil War or the
    Protectorate. I hope, however, that he will find some indication of
    the way in which the people of London regarded the events which were
    working out their redemption for them, in ways which were unexpected,
    by trials which were hard to bear, and after a time when all seemed
    lost.
  </p>

  <p>
    Considering London alone, the Restoration seems to me to have been
    a natural, a wholesome, and a most fortunate reaction against the
    successive rule of Presbyterian, Independent, and Captain or Colonel.
    It must have become quite clear even to men like Milton, who was one
    of the last to lift his voice against the return of a king, that a
    Commonwealth was too far in advance of the people, and that a military
    despotism was intolerable.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the same way the Revolution was a swing back of the pendulum; it was
    quite as natural and as salutary as the rebellion against Charles and
    the Restoration of his son. I read this lesson clearly in the history
    of London, and I assume it for the history of the country.
  </p>

  <p>
    Meantime let it be remembered that the seventeenth century secured the
    country for two hundred years, <i xml:lang="la">i.e.</i> to the present day at least, and,
    so far as can be prophesied, for an indefinite period yet to come,
    from the personal interference<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">viii</span>
    of the sovereign. That is an enormous
    gain to the country. We are no longer called upon to discuss the
    Prerogative. The attempted encroachments of George III. appear as mere
    trifles compared with the monstrous claims of Charles the First and the
    almost incredible acts of tyranny recorded of his son and successor.
    And in the achievement of this great result London in the seventeenth
    century played a noble part and earned the deepest gratitude of all
    those who came, or shall come, after.

      TRIUMPHAL ARCH ERECTED AT THE TIME OF THE CORONATION OF JAMES I.

  <p>
    James left Edinburgh on the 5th of April, arriving at Theobalds, where
    he rested for four days, on May the 7th; it had taken more than a month
    to ride from Edinburgh, <i xml:lang="la">i.e.</i> he had ridden about twelve miles a day.
    At Waltham he was met by one of the sheriffs with sixty servants; at
    Stamford Hill by the Mayor and Aldermen in velvet and gold chains and
    500 citizens richly apparelled. At that moment the Plague broke out;
    the Coronation was shorn of its splendour; the pageants and shows were
    laid aside; only the Mayor, Aldermen, and twelve citizens were present
    in Westminster Abbey; and James had to postpone his public entry into
    the City for a twelvemonth.
  </p>

  <p>
    With the accession of James revived the hopes of the Catholics; they
    built upon the inexperience and the ignorance of the King; perhaps
    upon his fears; they magnified their own strength and numbers; and
    they quite misunderstood the feeling of the country, which grew
    more and more in distrust and hatred of the Catholics. They began,
    moreover, just as they had done in the reign of Elizabeth, by plots
    and conspiracies. The first of these plots was that called the “Main,”
    in which Raleigh, unfortunately for himself and his own reputation,
    was concerned. With him was Lord Cobham. As to Raleigh’s guilt, this
    is not the place to inquire. As is well known, after twelve years he
    was suffered to come out of the Tower, and was allowed to command a
    fleet bound for the coast of South America in quest of gold-mines. The
    story of his voyage, of his ill success, of his son’s death, of his
    return, of his arrest, may be read in the history of England. But the
    tragedy of October 29, 1618, when at eight o’clock in the morning Sir
    Walter Raleigh was led out to die, moved to the depths every English
    heart, and should not be passed over in any history of London. It was
    remembered by all that he was the lifelong enemy of Spain, nor could
    the attacking of a friendly power in time of peace appear as any other
    than a laudable act to the English mind. That the traitor who arrested
    and betrayed him, his kinsman who became a paid spy, who also took
    money from the very man he was watching, that this man, Sir Lewis
    Stukeley, afterwards fell into misery and madness appeared to everybody
    an open and visible punishment inflicted by God Himself.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let us consider the meaning of the fines which play so large a part
    in the history of these times. If a man is a Roman Catholic he is on
    no account allowed to attend a church or assembly where any kind of
    service other than the Catholic is performed. That rule is never, I
    believe, relaxed under any circumstances. It is a rule, therefore,
    which can be easily used for the discovery of Catholics. Thus (23
    Elizabeth) it was enacted that every person over sixteen years of
    age who should refrain from attending at church, chapel, or some
    usual place of common prayer, against the tenor of a certain statute
    of the first year of her Majesty’s reign, for uniformity of common
    prayer, and should be lawfully convicted thereof, should forfeit, for
    each month in which he or she should so refrain,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span> the sum of twenty
    pounds of lawful money. The convictions under this statute illustrate
    to some extent the proportion of Roman Catholics to Protestants
    then existing in the country. Thus in the Middlesex Session Rolls
    (Middlesex County Record Society) may be found a long list of persons
    brought before the Middlesex magistrates charged with this offence.
    During the last twenty-four years of Queen Elizabeth’s reign there
    were 408 convictions of this offence in Middlesex alone. They were
    gentlemen and gentlewomen, clerks, yeomen, tradesmen, wives, widows,
    and spinsters. They came from many parts of Middlesex, but especially
    from Westminster, Clerkenwell, Tottenham, Stepney, and Holborn. A fine
    of twenty pounds a month—about £100 of our money—would be far beyond
    the means of most of the persons convicted. For instance, on one page
    of the Rolls there are the names of twenty-six persons all convicted
    of not going to church for two or three months. Of these, twelve are
    gentlemen, three are wives of gentlemen, five are yeomen, one is a
    spinster, four are clerks, and one is a cook. What happened when the
    fine could not be paid? The number of convictions proves, first, that
    there were some, but not, in proportion to the whole, many Roman
    Catholics left in London and the parts around; next, that they were
    easily detected by their absence from church; thirdly, that there was
    a hot search after them; and fourthly, that though we find, here and
    there, a person following a trade or a craft, the Catholics were for
    the most part gentlefolk.
  </p>

  <p>
    The secret professors of the ancient faith knew of places where a
    priest was concealed, and where Mass was sung or whispered with closed
    doors. There were five or six of these priests tried and condemned
    before the Middlesex magistrates. Thus John Welden in March 1587,
    William Hartley in 1588, Robert Walkinson in 1598 were tried and found
    guilty simply for being priests, <i xml:lang="la">i.e.</i> because, “being subjects of
    the Queen, they were ordained by authority derived from the See of
    Rome, in contempt of the Crown and Dignity of the said Queen.” They
    were executed as traitors with the cruelties of detail which we know.
    Other persons were charged with receiving, comforting, and maintaining
    priests. Thus George Glover and Mary Baylie his wife maintained and
    comforted Thomas Tycheburne, clerk and priest, and they received the
    pardon of the Queen; Catharine Bellamy, wife of Richard Bellamy,
    gentleman, moved and seduced by instigation of the devil, received
    and entertained Robert Southwell—it does not appear whether she was
    punished for the offence; and Dorothea White, either sister or wife of
    Humphrey White of Westminster, gentleman, thus received and entertained
    William Tedder, priest. Dorothea was hanged—one supposes—because she
    did not make submission.
  </p>

  <p>
    If we inquire into the comparative importance of the recusants, it
    seems that it must have been too small to constitute a real danger.
    The number, 408, convicted in a quarter of a century over the whole
    of Middlesex—London not included—that is, no more than an average of
    sixteen in a year, at a time when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
    the search after them was keen
    and untiring—hardly warrants the fears which were entertained by the
    Queen’s Council as to the power and numbers of the secret Catholics, or
    the hopes of support from the south which were entertained during the
    rising of the north; or the expectations at Rome and at the Court of
    Spain of a widespread insurrection all over England and a return to the
    ancient faith. At the same time it is reasonable to believe that there
    were many thousands who, while they adhered outwardly, went to church
    and heard the sermon, would have welcomed the return of the Mass and
    the Romish form.

    Action in the case of the recusants was followed by the famous
    Gunpowder Plot. There can be no doubt that the Catholics were maddened
    by disappointment, by persecution, by the failure to obtain toleration,
    and by the fines to which they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
    were subjected. The conspirators
    proposed, as is well known, to blow up the King, the Lords, and the
    Commons when the Parliament should assemble. This plot, like that of
    Raleigh, belongs to the history of the country.

    When the Common Council established a Court of Conscience in the City,
    it was with the design of saving poor debtors from the costs of being
    sued in the superior courts. But this Court was confined to debtors who
    were Citizens and Freemen of London and the Liberties. Some persons,
    intending to subvert the good and charitable intent of the Court, took
    hold of certain ambiguous words and endeavoured by means of these to
    render the intentions of the Court useless. A new and amending Act
    was passed which cleared up these difficulties and put the Court of
    Conscience on a sounder footing. The Act was well meant, but for more
    than two hundred years after it the miserable annals of the Debtors’
    Prisons are filled with stories of the exorbitant and extortionate
    costs charged by attornies, and with the sufferings of the debtors in
    consequence.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span></p>

  <p>
    The honour in which the City was held was illustrated when the King
    joined the Clothworkers’ Company, and when the Merchant Taylors, in
    jealousy, showed him their roll of members containing seven kings, one
    queen, seventeen princes and dukes, two duchesses, one archbishop,
    thirty earls, five countesses, one viscount, fourteen bishops,
    sixty-six barons, two ladies, seven abbots, seven priors, and an
    immense number of knights and esquires. The King gave them his son
    Henry as a member.

    The New River was completed after eight years of work. The length of
    the canal was 60 miles; it was crossed by 800 bridges, and five years
    were spent in the construction; the people were slow in taking their
    water from the new supply, probably because they detested changing
    their ways. The City was at first supplied with water from the Walbrook
    and the Fleet; there were also wells and springs on the rising ground
    of the Strand; in Moorfields, at Shoreditch, and elsewhere there were
    wells sunk within the City walls; and there were “bosses” or taps of
    fresh water brought in from Tyburn. All this, however, was not enough;
    the principal sources of supply, the Fleet and Walbrook, had long since
    ceased to be of any use. Powers therefore were sought to bring more
    water into the City, and were granted to bring water from Hampstead
    and from the river Lea; these powers were not, however, used. Improved
    works were set up at Tyburn; water mills were placed in the Thames, by
    which water was forced up and conveyed as far as Leadenhall. Finally,
    after a great deal of hesitation the City made use of these powers to
    construct a canal from springs at Chadwell and Amwell in Herts, and
    accepted the office of Hugh Middleton, a goldsmith, to execute the
    work. Middleton would have failed, however, but for the help of James,
    who agreed to pay half the cost of the work if Middleton gave him half
    the property. This was done in an assignment of thirty-six “King’s
    shares.” Charles parted with them for an annuity of £500. A few years
    ago an undivided share sold for £94,900. Yet Middleton died in reduced
    circumstances, unable to pay a loan which the City had advanced him on
    the progress of his work.

    The flight of the Earls of Tyrone and Tyrconnel in 1607 left without
    an owner a large tract of land in the north of Ireland which was
    confiscated to the Crown. It was proposed to colonise the district,
    and a scheme was drawn up for the “Plantation of Ulster.” The King
    proposed that the City should take part in this work; the citizens were
    assured that their own City was dangerously overcrowded with workmen
    and traders of all kinds, that the plantation would be an outlet
    much wanted, that the country was well watered and fertile, good for
    breeding cattle, well stocked with game and with fisheries; they were
    even told to consider how great a work had been done by the people of
    Bristol in settling Dublin. A fuller account of the Irish Estates will
    be found later on (p. 206).

      “The Audience Chamber was elegantly furnished, having a buffet of
      several stages, filled with various pieces of ancient and modern
      gilt plate of exquisite workmanship. A railing was placed on each
      side the room in order to prevent the crowd from approaching too
      near the table. At the right hand upon entering was another buffet,
      containing rich vessels of gold, agate, and other precious stones.
      The table might be about five yards in length, and more than one
      yard broad. The dishes were brought in by gentlemen and servants of
      the King, who were accompanied by the Lord Chamberlain, and before
      placing them on the table they made four or five obeisances. The
      Earls of Pembroke and Southampton officiated as gentlemen-ushers.
      Their Majesties, with the Prince Henry, entered after the Constable
      and the others, and placed themselves at their throne, and all
      stood in a line to hear the grace said; the Constable being at the
      King’s side, and the Count de Villamediana on the Queen’s. Their
      Majesties washed their hands in the same basin, the Lord Treasurer
      handing the towel to the King, and the High Admiral to the Queen.
      The Prince washed in another basin, in which water was also taken
      to the Constable, who was waited upon by the same gentlemen. They
      took their seats in the following manner: their Majesties sat at
      the head of the table, at a distance from each other, under the
      canopy of state, the Queen being on the right hand, on chairs of
      brocade with cushions; and at her side, a little apart, sat the
      Constable, on a tabouret of brocade with a high cushion of the
      same, and on the side of the King the Prince was seated in like
      manner. On the opposite side of the table and on the right sat
      Count Villamediana, and next to him the Senator Rovida opposite the
      Constable; and on the same side with the senator, nearly fronting
      the Prince, were seated the President Richardot and the Audiencier,
      a space in front being left vacant owing to the absence of the
      Count d’Arembergue, who was prevented by the gout from attending.
      The principal noblemen of the kingdom were likewise at the table,
      in particular the Duke of Lennox; the Earl of Arundel; the Earl of
      Suffolke, Lord Chamberlain; the Earl of Dorset, Lord Treasurer;
      the Earl of Nottingham, High Admiral; the Earls of Devonshire, of
      Southampton, and of Pembroke; the Earl of Northumberland; the Earl
      of Worcester, Master of the Horse; the Earls of Shrewsbury, of
      Sussex, of Derby, and of Essex, and the Lord Chancellor—all being
      Knights of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
      Garter; also Barons Cecil and Wotton and the Lord Kinross, a privy
      councillor; Sir Thomas Erskine, Captain of the Guard; Sir John
      Ramsay and James Lindsay, Scotchmen; and other barons and gentlemen
      of quality. There was plenty of instrumental music and the banquet
      was sumptuous and profuse. The first thing the King did was to send
      the Constable a melon and half-a-dozen oranges on a very green
      branch, telling him that they were the fruit of Spain transplanted
      into England; to which the latter, kissing his hand, replied that
      he valued the gift more as coming from his Majesty than as being
      the fruit of his own country; he then divided the melon with
      their Majesties, and Don Blasco de Aragon handed the plate to the
      Queen, who politely and graciously acknowledged the attention.
      Soon afterwards the King stood up, and with his head uncovered
      drank to the Constable the health of their Spanish Majesties, and
      may the peace be happy and perpetual. The Constable pledged him
      in like manner, and replied that he entertained the same hope and
      that from the peace the greatest advantages might result to both
      crowns and to Christendom. The toast was then drunk by the Count
      Villamediana and the others present, to the delight and applause
      of their Majesties. Immediately afterwards, the Constable, seeing
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
      that another opportunity might not be afforded him, rose and
      drank to the King the health of the Queen from the lid of a cup
      of agate of extraordinary beauty and richness, set with diamonds
      and rubies, praying his Majesty would condescend to drink the
      toast from the cup, which he did accordingly, and ordered it to
      be passed round to the Prince and the others; and the Constable
      directed that the cup should remain in his Majesty’s buffet. At
      this period the people shouted out, ‘Peace, peace, peace! God
      save the King! God save the King! God save the King!’ and a king
      at arms presented himself before the table, and after the drums,
      trumpets, and other instruments had sounded, with a loud voice said
      in English: ‘That the kingdom returned many thanks to his Majesty
      for having concluded with the King of Spain so advantageous a
      peace, and he prayed to God that it might endure for many ages, and
      his subjects hoped that his Majesty would endeavour with all his
      might to maintain it so that they might enjoy from it tranquillity
      and repose, and that security and advantage might result to all
      his people; and therefore they prayed him to allow the same to
      be published in the kingdoms and dominions of his Majesty.’ At
      length, after other healths and messages from the King and Queen,
      it was brought to a conclusion, having lasted about three hours.
      The cloth having been removed, every one immediately rose up; the
      table was placed upon the ground, and their Majesties standing
      upon it, proceeded to wash their hands, which is stated to be an
      ancient ceremony. The Constable invited Count Villamediana to wash
      in his basin, and the other Commissioners washed in others. Their
      Majesties then withdrew to their apartment, and the Constable and
      Count were conducted to a handsome gallery, adorned with various
      paintings, where they remained more than an hour. In the meantime
      dancing had begun in the said Audience Chamber, and the Constable
      and Count were informed in the name of their Majesties that they
      were then waiting for them to go and see it.

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      After a little while the Prince Henry was commanded by his parents
      to dance a galliard, and they pointed out to him the lady who was
      to be his partner; and this he did with much sprightliness and
      modesty, cutting several capers in the course of the dance....
      The ball ended, and then all took their places at the windows of
      the room, which looked out upon a square where a platform was
      raised, and a vast crowd had assembled to see the King’s bears
      fight with greyhounds. This afforded great amusement. Presently a
      bull, tied to the end of a rope, was fiercely baited by dogs. After
      this certain tumblers came, who danced upon a rope and performed
      curious feats of agility and skill on horseback. With this ended
      the entertainment and the day, and their Majesties now retired,
      being accompanied by the Constable and the other noblemen to their
      apartment, before entering which, many compliments passed on both
      sides, and their Majesties and the Prince shook hands with the
      Constable and the Count; and the other Spanish cavaliers kissed
      hands and took their departure. The Constable and the others, upon
      quitting the ball-room, were accompanied by the Lord Chamberlain
      to the farthest room, and by the Earl of Devonshire and other
      gentlemen to their coaches, more than fifty halberdiers lighting
      them with torches until they reached home, where as many others
      were waiting their arrival. Being fatigued, the Constable and the
      Count supped that night in private, and the others at the ordinary
      table.”

    The mind of the City in 1607 was greatly exercised with a question of
    precedence. The question, which was submitted to the King, and by him
    submitted to the Court Marshal, was as follows:—
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “Whether a Commoner dignified with knighthood, without any other
      advantage of honour by employment or otherwise, and using trade and
      keeping shop in the City, should take place of an Alderman Knight
      within the same City, contrary to this beautified order, of ancient
      time settled and confirmed, with such charters and grants from his
      Majesty; or whether any other Bachelor Knight shall take place of
      any Alderman within this City?”

    town ditch—the last of such orders. In 1598 Stow wrote that it was
    stopped up and choked:—
  </p>

  <p>
    “Now of late neglected and forced either to a very narrow, and the same
    a filthy channel, or altogether stopped up for gardens planted, and
    houses built thereon; even to the very wall, and in many places upon
    both ditch and wall houses to be built; to what danger of the City, I
    leave to wiser consideration, and can but wish that reformation might
    be had.”
  </p>

  <p>
    It had been cleansed in 1519, 1540, 1569, and 1595, but apparently
    only in part. Thus in 1519 between Aldgate and the Tower postern, the
    same part in 1540, the same part again in 1569, and the part between
    Bishopsgate and the postern of Moorgate in 1595. I do not understand
    the reason of these repeated cleansings of parts.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 1614 Smithfield, which had now become the cattle-market of the City,
    and was therefore a place of very great resort, continued to be without
    pavement of any kind, so that during or after rainy weather it was
    absolutely impassable for mud and mire. King James called the attention
    of the Mayor to this scandal, and ordered that the place should be
    paved. This was done. The paving was the old-fashioned cobble; it took
    six months to lay down, and cost £1600.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the same time the laying down of broad freestones instead of the old
    cobbles was commenced. Those of the inhabitants who chose laid down the
    stones before their own doors. We must understand, therefore, that all
    the important streets at this time were paved with cobbles; that in a
    few of the principal thoroughfares there was a pavement of flat stones,
    but not uniform; and that there were many courts and alleys where there
    was no kind of pavement at all. We may further understand that this was
    the London of Hogarth as well as of James I.
  </p>

  <p>
    On July 8, 1614, the Lord Mayor sent a communication to the Lord
    Chamberlain detailing the steps he had taken in reforming disorderly
    practices (<cite>Remembrancia</cite>, p. 358):—
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      <i>Firstly.</i>—He had freed the streets of a swarm of loose and idle
      vagrants, providing for the relief of such as were not able to get
      their living, and keeping them at work in Bridewell, not punishing
      any for begging, but setting them on work, which was worse than
      death to them.
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>Secondly.</i>—He had informed himself, by means of spies, of many
      lewd houses, and had gone himself disguised to divers of them, and
      finding these nurseries of villany, had punished them according to
      their deserts, some by carting and whipping, and many by banishment.
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>Thirdly.</i>—Finding the gaol pestered with prisoners, and their
      bane to take root and beginning at ale-houses, and much mischief
      to be there plotted, with great waste of corn in brewing heady
      strong beer, many consuming all their time and sucking that sweet
      poison, he had taken an exact survey of all victualling-houses and
      ale-houses, which were above a thousand, and above 300 barrels
      of strong beer in some houses, the whole quantity of beer in
      victualling-houses amounting to above 40,000 barrels; he had
      thought it high time to abridge their number and limit them by
      bonds as to the quantity of beer they should use, and as to what
      orders they should observe, whereby the price of corn and malt had
      greatly fallen.
    </p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span></p>

    <p>
      <i>Fourthly.</i>—The Bakers and Brewers had been drawn within bounds, so
      that, if the course continued, men might have what they paid for,
      viz. weight and measure.
    </p>

    <p>
      He had also endeavoured to keep the Sabbath day holy, for which he
      had been much maligned.
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>Fifthly.</i>—If what he had done were well taken, he would proceed
      further, viz. to deal with thieving brokers or broggers, who were
      the receivers of all stolen goods.
    </p>

    <p>
      And lastly, the inmates of infected houses would require before
      summer to be discharged of all superfluities for avoiding
      infection, etc.
    </p>

  <p>
    Returning from Scotland in 1618 James observed that certain persons of
    Lancashire, whom he called Puritans, and precise people, had interfered
    by prohibiting such “lawful recreations and honest exercises upon
    Sundays and other holidays<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
    after the afternoon sermon or service”
    as the peasantry had been accustomed to indulge in; he therefore
    issued a declaration setting forth that this prohibition “barreth the
    common and meaner sort of people from using such exercises as may make
    their bodies more able for war, when we or our successors shall have
    occasion to use them; and in place thereof sets up filthy tiplings and
    drunkenness, and breeds a number of idle and discontented speeches
    in their ale-houses: for when shall the common people have leave to
    exercise, if not upon the Sundays and holidays, seeing they must apply
    their labour, and win their living, in all working days?”
  </p>

  <p>
    The King therefore commanded that no recreations should be denied to
    his subjects which did not militate against the laws and the canons
    of the Church. “And as for our good people’s lawful recreation, our
    pleasure likewise is that after the end of divine services our good
    people may not be disturbed, letted, or discouraged from any lawful
    recreation, such as dancing, either men or women, archery for men,
    leaping, vaulting, or any other such harmless recreation: nor from
    having of May games, Whitsun ales, and Morris dances, and the setting
    up of May-poles, and other sports therewith used, as the same be had
    in due and convenient time without impediment or neglect of divine
    service; and that women shall have leave to carry rushes to the church
    for the decorating of it, according to their old custom. But withall,
    we do here account still as prohibited all unlawful games to be used
    upon Sunday only, as bear and bull-baiting, interludes, and, at all
    times in the meaner sort of people by law prohibited, bowling.”
  </p>

  <p>
    The famous Book of Sports, which laid down rules as to games and
    sports lawful to be played on the Sunday, was ordered to be read in
    every parish church throughout the country. The reception of the
    proclamation, especially in the City, seems to have surprised the
    King’s advisers. Neither James nor his son could ever understand the
    extent or the depth of the new ideas in religion. Sunday, in the eyes
    of most people who thought about religion at all—that is, in the eyes
    of all responsible persons in London, which was a hot-bed of religious
    controversy—had become the Jewish Sabbath. Most of the City clergy
    refused absolutely to read the Book of Sports in their churches,
    choosing to be fined or suspended and imprisoned rather than obey.
    These punishments they endured. But the feeling in the City ran very
    high, insomuch that the Lord Mayor refused permission for the King’s
    carriages to be drawn through the City on Sunday during Divine Service.
    There was, naturally, great indignation at Court. The King made the
    customary observation about two Kings in the country. However, he sent
    his carriages back with a warrant to let them pass. This the Mayor
    obeyed, saying that he had done his duty, but that what one in higher
    authority commanded, he must obey. So no more was said, and the City,
    in the matter of the Book of Sports, had peace.
  </p>

  <p>
    The story of the settlement of Virginia is a pleasing episode of this
    reign. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
    shows the City at its best, wise, patriotic, generous,
    and far-seeing. Taking this history with that of the plantation of
    Ulster, we have a proof that the City was at this time overcrowded and
    congested. When the latter scheme was first set afoot the citizens were
    reminded that the City was so crowded that one tradesman was hardly
    able to live by another, and when the Virginian colony was mooted
    it was proposed to relieve the streets by sending out all the idle
    children.

  <p>
    The Company for colonising Virginia was founded in 1609. The promoters
    assured the Mayor, then Sir Humphry Wild, that if the surplus
    population of London could be transferred to Virginia there would be
    far less danger of pestilence and famine. By way of attracting people
    willing to emigrate, meat, drink, and clothing, with a house, orchard,
    and garden, and an allotment of land, were offered.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span> Any alderman
    subscribing £50 would be reckoned an original member of the Council.
    “Bills of Association” were given to all who subscribed, entitling them
    to a <i xml:lang="la">pro rata</i> share in the profits. Fifty-six of the Companies agreed
    to take ventures in the plantations. On May 23, 1609, the Company
    received a second charter, and in the same month the first fleet of
    seven ships was dispatched. The ships took three months to get across;
    yellow fever broke out among their crews and passengers, the number of
    whom were sadly reduced when they landed.
  </p>

  <p>
    In two years’ time the Company had got through all their money,
    though they had raised £18,000 since their first fleet went out. They
    obtained, however, a third charter, with the addition of the Bermudas,
    and they held a public lottery. It is remarkable to find the City
    Companies and the City churches, or vestries, taking shares in this
    lottery.
  </p>

  <p>
    Two years later a second lottery was set on foot. In 1618 it was
    decided to take up vagrant boys and girls in the streets and to
    transport them to Virginia. This was done. A beginning was made with
    100, who were shipped across so successfully that the Corporation sent
    over another hundred. The children cost £5 each, including their voyage
    and their clothing. The Common Council paid for both shiploads by a
    rate levied on the City.
  </p>

  <p>
    Next, the King complained that whole companies of lazy rogues and
    masterless men followed the Court. The Virginia Company laid hands
    on all, put them into Bridewell, and as soon as possible packed them
    off for the Plantation. But the infant colony suffered in 1622 from a
    treacherous attack made upon the people by the Indians, in which 350
    of the settlers perished. The Court of Common Council voted another
    £500 for another shipload of boys and girls. The question of beggars,
    vagrants, and disorderly persons was constantly before the authorities.
    The difficulty has always been the same. If they are suppressed one
    day, they gather again the next.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the year 1614 the City began a very mean and unworthy practice;
    that, namely, of electing to the office of Sheriff those who would
    rather pay the fine than serve. In this year nearly a dozen were
    elected, all of whom declined to serve.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the same year the Mayor and Corporation received a reminder that
    the City was expected to keep a force of militia always equipped and
    drilled. They therefore resolved on raising a force of 6000 men; the
    Aldermen were provided with precepts stating the number of men wanted
    from each ward, with the kind of arms and armour which they were to
    bring with them. A list of prices at which the arms could be procured
    was appended to the precept:—
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “Jerome Heydon, described as ‘iremonger at the lower end of
      Cheapeside,’ was ready to sell corslets, comprising ‘brest, backe,
      gorgett, taces and headpiece,’ at 15s.; pikes with steel heads at
      2s. 6d.; swords, being Turkey blades, at 7s.; ‘bastard’ muskets at
      14s.; great muskets with rests, at 16s.; a headpiece, lined and
      stringed, at 2s. 6d., and a bandaleer for 1s. 6d. Henry White and
      Don Sany Southwell were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
      prepared to do corslets 6d. cheaper, and
      the same with swords, but their swords are described as only ‘Irish
      hilts and belts to them.’ Their bastard muskets, ‘with mouldes,’
      could be had for 13s., or 1s. cheaper than those of Jerome Heydon.
      The Armourers’ Company were ready to supply corslets at 15s., but
      for the same ‘with pouldrons’ they asked 4s. more. The Cutlers’
      Company would furnish ‘a very good turky blade and good open hilts’
      for 6s., thus underselling the private firms.”
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    The interference of James with the Merchant Adventurers in 1615 is
    difficult to understand. He suppressed the Company, withdrew all
    licences for the exportation of undyed and undressed cloth, and formed
    a new company. The Dutch threatened to set up looms for themselves and
    to destroy the English trade in cloth, but the new company proved a
    failure, and the old company was restored.
  </p>

  <p>
    The charter granted by James in the sixth year of his reign confirmed
    all the ancient rights, liberties, and immunities of the citizens, and
    added to the bounds of the City and its jurisdiction, the precincts of
    Duke’s Place, St. Bartholomew’s the Great and Less, Black and White
    Friars, and Cold Harbour.
  </p>

  <p>
    Yet the same anxiety which possessed the Government in the reign of
    Elizabeth as to the increase of London was shown by that of James in
    his very first year, when he issued a proclamation putting a stop to
    the building of new houses in the suburbs. It was ordered that no one
    should build on new foundations, and that all houses so built should
    be pulled down. The frequency of these proclamations shows that the
    Government was in earnest on the subject. No doubt the ordinance was
    evaded because the suburbs were actually increasing, and that rapidly,
    but a great many persons would be deterred by fear of breaking the law,
    and would either remain in the City, which was greatly overcrowded, or
    go across the river and occupy Southwark, which began to fill up fast,
    along the causeway and embankment, and to grow also by putting out new
    streets on either side of the former and along the road to Bermondsey.
    The year after a third proclamation was issued to the same effect;
    no one was to build on new foundations within two miles of the City.
    The people paid no attention to this proclamation, and building went
    on without molestation for some years, when the builders were called
    upon either to buy their own houses at an extravagant price or to pull
    them down. This mode of enforcing the law would not be approved at the
    present day; in 1617 it put money into James’s pocket.
  </p>

  <p>
    Six years later another proclamation was published to the same effect,
    acknowledging the futility of the former law.
  </p>

  <p>
    On a certain Sunday afternoon, the 26th of October 1623, occurred
    a disaster, called the Fatal Vespers, which was long remembered as
    a signal proof of Heaven’s wrath against those who followed Popish
    worship. The French Ambassador at that time had a house in Blackfriars,
    adjoining which there was a large upper chamber, sometimes used as
    the Ambassador’s chapel, about 60 feet long and 20 feet broad. Roman
    Catholics in London frequented the chapels at the various embassies.
    But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
    this was not the French Ambassador’s chapel, which was within his
    house. Perhaps the occasion demanded a larger room.
  </p>

  <p>
    On this afternoon about 300 persons were assembled to celebrate
    evensong and to hear a sermon from a Jesuit named Father Drury, a
    person held in great repute for his learning, his blameless life, and
    laudable conversation. The congregation consisted of English, Scotch,
    Irish, and Welsh. The sermon began between three and four in the
    afternoon. The text was the parable of the king and the servant whom he
    forgave.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the midst of the sermon the beams and side timbers of the floor
    suddenly gave way and fell with all the people upon the floor of the
    room below. This in its turn being broken through, all fell upon the
    lowest floor, where they lay piled together with the beams and broken
    planks. The only persons who did not fall were some thirty sitting or
    standing in a corner where the beams held fast. These people with their
    knives cut a hole in the wall, and so got safely into the Ambassador’s
    house.
  </p>

  <p>
    Meanwhile people came running with spades and pickaxes to extricate the
    sufferers from the ruins.
  </p>

  <p>
    It took the whole of that day and night to bring out all the people.
    Out of the 300 who were assembled in the evening some thirty we have
    said did not fall with the rest. Ninety-five were found to be dead,
    including the preacher, Father Drury, and a great many were maimed and
    bruised.
  </p>

  <p>
    The story of a tumult by the City ’prentices suggests the fourteenth
    century. It began with one of them crying out when Gondomar, the
    Spanish Ambassador, was being carried down Fleet Street in his chair,
    “There goes the devil in a dung-cart.” Upon which one of the suite
    retorted sharply. Then the apprentice knocked down the Spaniard. For
    this offence he with his companions was ordered to be whipped through
    the City. Thereupon the apprentices rose, 300 strong, and released
    their companions. However, it could not be endured that an Ambassador
    should be insulted, and the sentence was carried out. One of the
    apprentices died, presumably from the severity of his punishment; the
    others were released, and when it was known, later on, that the Spanish
    match had fallen through, the Londoners expressed the liveliest joy,
    bonfires were lit, bells rung, tables were spread in the streets, casks
    were broached, and all because the Prince was coming home—without the
    Infanta.
  </p>

  <p>
    All that precedes concerning the reign of James I. touches the surface
    of things. These events might have been observed by any casual
    by-stander, and understood by him as possessing no significance as to
    the mind of the people and the City.
  </p>

  <p>
    We have now to consider the influence of James, not on the country
    at large, where opinion was slow in coming to a head, so much as in
    the City, where, with 100,000 gathered closely together, and that
    within hearing of Whitehall, suspicion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
    and jealousy, once awakened,
    became rapidly opinion, and opinion became conviction, and the settled
    conviction of the City, once known and formulated, proved the most
    important weapon of all those forged by the pedantry and obstinacy
    of James, and the equal obstinacy and wrongheadedness of Charles. In
    other words, it is necessary in this place to show, if possible, that
    in a closer sense than is usual the years 1603–1625 were a preparation
    for the appeal to arms, by which the liberties of the country were
    secured. I prepare, therefore, to pass in very brief review some of the
    leading political events of the time, in order to show how the City was
    affected by them.
  </p>

  <p>
    To begin with, the City was fiercely Protestant. The Catholic reaction,
    which had stayed the spread of Continental Protestantism, only made
    England more doggedly Protestant. That a new life had been imparted
    to the Catholic Church by the Jesuits and the new orders made the
    Englishman only the more hostile to a church which threatened his
    nationality, his liberties, everything that he held most sacred. Again,
    to the Protestant spirit belonged the right of free thought and free
    doctrine as against authority. Scholars and divines were satisfied
    with the purely personal relations between God and man, which they
    had substituted for the priest and the sacerdotal authority. What the
    Protestant clergy wanted, what they asked of James in the Millenary
    Petition was a reform in the ecclesiastical courts, the removal of
    certain superstitious usages from the Prayer Book, the more rigorous
    observance of Sunday, and the training of preachers. “Why,” asked
    Bacon—he might have asked the same question to-day—“should the civil
    state be purged and restored by good and wholesome laws made every
    three years in Parliament assembled, devising remedies as fast as
    time breedeth mischief, and contrariwise the ecclesiastical state
    still continue upon the dregs of time, and receive no alteration these
    forty-five years and more?”
  </p>

  <p>
    However, James had not the least intention of making any change in the
    ecclesiastical courts.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moreover, he had already declared his views as to the rights of
    the sovereign. “A king, he said, is not bound to frame his actions
    according to law, but of his own free will, and for giving an example
    to his people.” Convocation was quick to adopt this view and to
    denounce as a fatal error the doctrine that all power is derived from
    the people. Later on, the University of Oxford proclaimed the doctrine
    of passive resistance. It is difficult to speak with moderation of
    these two opinions, or to estimate how far they are responsible for the
    bloodshed of the Civil War.
  </p>

  <p>
    How James carried on his government for seven years without a
    Parliament belongs to national history. We may, however, picture
    the wrath and exasperation of the City at the encroachments of the
    spiritual courts, the subserviency of the lawyers and judges, the
    extortions, the sale of peerages, and the dismissal of the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span> Chief
    Justice. We can also imagine the whispers that went round concerning
    the Court, its extravagance, the shameless promotion of favourites, the
    scandals, the attempt to form a Spanish alliance.
  </p>

  <p>
    We may sum up this ignoble reign, so far as concerns London, by saying
    that the attitude of the City during the whole of it was one of
    observation and endurance. We have seen something of what was observed.
    There were, however, other things of which the City took silent note.
    To begin with, James, while he proclaimed the Royal prerogative, threw
    away the Royal dignity. He was extravagant and in foolish ways; he
    loved favourites and they were unworthy; his son was the idol of the
    people, but James affected no grief for him, nay, it was even whispered
    that the young Prince was poisoned, and with the guilty knowledge
    of his father; he hated Puritans and persecuted Catholics; he spent
    most of his time in hunting; it was commonly reported that he drank
    heavily; his servants were left without their wages; his purveyors
    refused supplies until they were paid; he was always preaching the
    Royal prerogative; he was anxious to enter upon a marriage with Spain,
    the arch-enemy of the Protestant religion; he tried to bully the House
    of Commons, but got nothing from them; he granted monopolies, a thing
    abhorrent to the commercial mind. All these things London observed and
    marked, and they bore their fruit in the reign of James’s son, and
    those of his two grandsons. But as yet resistance—armed resistance—was
    not even thought of. Plots and conspiracies there were, but of small
    account. Of armed resistance on behalf of the liberties of the country
    as yet there was no idea.

    <span class="smcap">The</span> history of Charles shows, if we consider nothing more than his
    dealings with the City of London, a wrongheadedness which is most
    amazing. It is true that two at least of the Tudor sovereigns had ruled

    as well as feared, and they knew, further, how timely concessions in
    small things may overcome resistance in great things. Moreover, we have
    seen how James had endeavoured to make himself an absolute monarch,
    and the results which followed. As the event proved, the side taken by
    London in this reign was once more the winning side; as it was with
    Richard the Second and Henry the Sixth, so it was with Charles the
    First.

  <p>
    I have attempted to indicate something of the effect produced upon
    the City by the reign of James I. I have now to show the fruits of
    that reign, followed by another even more obstinately arbitrary; even
    blinder to the threatening wave that was rising and swelling before
    the King’s feet, so that it was impossible, one would have thought,
    not to see it and to understand it. The unbroken contumacy of the
    House of Commons, whenever it had a chance of speaking, was not that
    a sign which might have been read by the King and his Ministers? The
    sullen attitude of the City—was not that a sign? Charles, however,
    saw nothing, or, if he saw, then he thought the opposition feeble
    compared with the forces at his own disposal. Nothing, however, seems
    to have been further from his thoughts than armed resistance. Let us
    remember, however, that at the outset Charles had to face an angry
    and discontented City; angry on account of the ecclesiastical courts
    and the impossibility of redress; discontented on account of the late
    King’s deliberate trampling upon all its liberties.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the 28th of April, Charles was proclaimed King at Ludgate Hill,
    himself being present. On the 1st of May he was married by proxy
    in Paris to Henrietta Maria. The new Queen came over at once, and
    received a kindly welcome from the citizens. The public entry, which
    was arranged for June 18, was postponed on account of another outbreak
    of plague. The number of deaths from this visitation is returned at
    35,417, about one-third of the whole population. As in 1603, and
    later on in 1665, the richer sort hurried out of the town on the
    first outbreak, leaving behind them the population which cannot leave
    the place of work, namely, the apprentices, craftsmen, servants, and
    porters. The rich carried away what they could, but they were refused
    entrance into the villages, even the barns being closed to them. Many
    of them died on the highway, their pockets stuffed with money.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the midst of this terrible time Charles called upon the City to
    raise and equip 1000 men for the new expedition. This was done, and
    the men were raised somehow, and marched down to Plymouth, where they
    awaited the arrival of the Fleet with no pay and no provisions. Finally
    the Fleet arrived, and they went on board, bound for Cadiz, there to
    experience failure.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Parliament of 1626 refused to grant supplies until grievances had
    been considered. Charles therefore dissolved it. This was like his
    father. He would get on without the Parliament. He began by calling
    upon the City to lend him £100,000. The City refused, they had no
    money, they were just recovering from the Plague; they lent, however,
    £20,000 on good security. Next came a demand for 4000 men and 20 ships,
    the first for the defence of Sheppey, and the second in order to carry
    the war into the enemy’s country. To the first the City replied
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span> that
    the order came from some of the lords and not from the King, and that
    by charter their soldiers were for the defence of the City and must
    not go farther than the Mayor himself may go. As we have seen in the
    past, this right was always put forward when the City did not want to
    obey the King, and always neglected when the City was willing that
    its troops should go anywhere, as, for instance, in the deposition of
    Richard the Second, in the siege of Winchester under Stephen, and in
    the defence of the country against the Spanish Armada.
  </p>

  <p>
    As for the ships, the Mayor was instructed to reply that the City
    was in a most impoverished condition, that they could not get the
    ships ready in the time, and that the merchants would far rather have
    letters of mark and go out privateering. However, the City gave way.
    It is an indication of the poverty of the City at this time that the
    small sum of £18,000 wanted for fitting out the ships could not be
    raised. Many of the people steadfastly refused to pay their rate; the
    constables refused to distrain; the people helped one another when the
    constables tried to do their duty. Meantime the streets of the City
    were thronged with sailors clamouring for their pay; they mobbed the
    Duke of Buckingham, who put them off with promises. Charles had no
    money to give them. He endeavoured to get supplies by the “Forced Loan”
    of 1626. The City was left for a time, but when in 1627 war broke out
    between France and England it became necessary to press for the loan.
    Some persons refused to give any money and were committed to prison;
    the judges declared the loan illegal. The City, however, after long
    discussions, resolved on lending the King another sum of £120,000,
    provided it was amply secured.

  <p>
    The unpopularity of Buckingham, upon whom was laid the odium of
    failure, is shown in the very strange story of the murder of Dr. Lambe.
    Lambe was an astrologer and a creature of Buckingham’s. The account of
    his death is told in three ways. First, that of Dr. Reginald Sharpe
    (<cite>London and the Kingdom</cite>, ii.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
    p. 105). He says that Lambe was set
    upon by some of the people in the City on his way home after supper,
    that they did him nearly to death, and that no one would receive the
    wounded man, who was taken to the compter, and died the next day. The
    other accounts are more elaborate and more unreal. They are as follows:—
  </p>

  <p>
    1. He was insulted by a few boys, who were joined by the rabble, so
    that he took refuge in a tavern in the Old Jewry. The vintner, for his
    own safety, turned him out, whereupon the mob beat him to death before
    the Mayor’s guard could reach the spot.
  </p>

    <div class="caption">HENRIETTA MARIA (1609–1669)
      <div class="subcap">From an engraving by Voerts, after Van Dyck.</div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    2. He was in Cheapside, where he was insulted by the boys, who were
    joined by the mob; he ran into a house of Wood Street, where the people
    broke all the windows. He was forced to leave his refuge, and was then
    seized by the mob, who dragged him along, striking and kicking him. The
    account goes on to say that the news of the tumult reaching the King,
    he rode, accompanied by a small guard, into the City, and found in St.
    Paul’s Churchyard the mob, still beating and kicking the man; that he
    addressed the mob and bade them desist; that they replied that they had
    already judged him; and in fact they had so dislocated his limbs that
    he was dead. Charles, having so small a guard, was obliged to retire.
  </p>

  <p>
    The second of these two accounts is clearly false, because Wood Street
    is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
    only a few minutes’ walk from St. Paul’s Churchyard; the noise of
    a City disturbance would not reach Whitehall; when the news of it did
    reach Whitehall, the thing must have been over, unless the kicking and
    striking lasted for an hour; it would take quite an hour for the riot
    to be reported to the King, and for him to get ready his escort and to
    ride to St. Paul’s.
  </p>

  <p>
    In any case there is no doubt that the man Lambe was murdered by the
    London mob; also that the King was greatly incensed at the matter, for
    he wrote an angry letter to the Mayor calling for the punishment of the
    murderers. The Mayor replied that he could not find any; the City was
    therefore fined £6000, which, on their arresting a few men, was reduced
    to 1500 marks or £1000. It has been suggested that the money was all
    that Charles wanted. If so, why did he reduce the fine? It is much more
    probable that he was personally concerned at the murder.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are many indications that the people were getting beyond the
    control of the Mayor and Aldermen. The murder of Lambe was only one of
    the many riotous affairs which occurred during this reign. In 1630 the
    Sheriff’s officers having arrested a man in Fleet Street, the populace
    rose and attempted a rescue. The Sheriff’s officers were supported
    by watchmen, constables, and some of the citizens who joined them; a
    fight ensued, in which many were killed and wounded. The Mayor, with a
    company of the trained bands, arrived upon the scene and stopped the
    battle. Several ringleaders were arrested, and one, Henry Stamford by
    name, was executed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Again, in 1640, the City being greatly enraged against the Archbishop
    of Canterbury, a body of five hundred ’prentices gathered together by
    night and ran to Lambeth, intending to sack and destroy the Palace;
    the Archbishop, however, had got wind of their design, and was strong
    enough to beat them off. The ’prentices also broke up the sittings of
    the High Commissioner of St. Paul’s.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another pestilence visited the City in 1629, remaining till 1631.
    It was followed, as usual, by distress and scarcity of provisions.
    Doggerel rhymes (<cite>Sharpe</cite>, ii. 109) appeared showing the temper of the
    people:—
  </p>

  <div class="center-container">

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">
    One of the advantages of keeping all the shops of one trade in the same
    quarter is illustrated by the story of the Queen’s loss by robbery. It
    was in the year 1631 that a part of her plate and jewels was stolen.
    The purchasers of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
    stolen property must have been the goldsmiths,
    and unless the stolen plate had been sent abroad, it might be recovered
    by finding to what goldsmith it had been offered on purchase. Until the
    beginning of the seventeenth century all the goldsmiths lived together
    in Cheapside. As early as 1623 it was observed that many of them were
    leaving their old quarters and setting up shops elsewhere. They were
    ordered to go back to their old quarters, but, as generally happened
    with such orders, there were no means of enforcing them, and the
    goldsmiths continued to scatter themselves about the town. Then came
    the Queen’s loss, and it was found that the order had been entirely
    neglected. The Lords in Council, therefore, renewed the order on the
    ground that by leaving Cheapside and setting up their shops in other
    places, they offered facilities for “passing away of stolen plate.”
    This order of Council was issued in 1635. As very little attention
    was paid to the order, which was certainly vexatious, it was renewed
    on May 24, 1637, and was followed by an order of the Court of Star
    Chamber that if any other tradesmen besides goldsmiths should keep shop
    in Cheapside or Lombard Street, the Alderman should be imprisoned for
    permitting it. As little attention was paid to this order, a fourth,
    to the same effect, was issued in January 1638. In the last the names
    of some offenders were given; there were two stationers, a milliner, a
    bandseller, a drugster, a cook, and a girdler. This interference with
    the conduct of trade was part of a general and systematic attempt to
    make the King master in everything. He could not possibly have made
    a greater mistake than to interfere with the trading interests or to
    meddle with the way in which a money-making community conducted its
    affairs. The goldsmiths who had left Cheapside had done so in their own
    interests; by scattering, each shop formed its own circle; to give up
    that circle would be to give up the shopkeeper’s livelihood; they had
    found out by this time that in a great city of 150,000 people, trade is
    more successful when the shops of the same kind are scattered. Imagine
    the wrath of Cheapside at the present day if all the shops except those
    of one trade were ordered to depart!
  </p>

  <p>
    The business of the ship money is by some historians considered
    the greatest of all the King’s mistakes; but that of the Cheapside
    tradesmen touched a lower level, and therefore a wider area. To bleed
    the rich merchants was one thing, to deprive an honest tradesman of his
    shop was more serious, because of tradesmen there were more than of
    merchants. A charter confirming the City liberties produced no change
    in the King’s policy. It was signed while the disputes concerning ship
    money, Irish Estates, and interference with trade were at their height,
    and it cost the City £12,000.
  </p>

  <p>
    When we read of ships being fitted out by London, of the fleet equipped
    by Sir John Philpott, of the solid support given to the fleet which
    engaged the Spanish Armada, and of other occasions, it is difficult
    to understand the objections<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
    of London to raise the ship money, save
    on the supposition that they now perceived that the King meant to go
    as far as he could in the way of despotic power, and that it behoved
    them to make a stand and to fight every inch of ground. This they
    prepared to do. First they set their law officers to hunt up charters
    and Acts of Parliament. The case complete, they presented a petition
    to the King, stating that by certain Acts recited the City was exempt
    from such obligations. However, the City got nothing by its petition
    except a peremptory order to raise the £30,000 wanted, and to raise it
    at once. The City gave way and proceeded to obey and to fit out seven
    ships.
  </p>

  <p>
    The impost of ship money, which ultimately caused Charles I. so
    much trouble, was suggested to him in 1631 by Sir William Noye,
    Attorney-General, who had found among the records in the Tower, not
    only writs compelling the ports on certain occasions to provide ships
    for the use of the King, but others obliging their neighbours of the
    maritime counties to contribute to the expense. Writs were issued to
    London and the different ports, October 20, 1634, ordering them to
    supply a certain number of ships of a specified tonnage, sufficiently
    armed and manned, to rendezvous at Portsmouth on the 1st of March 1635.
    The writ is set out in Howell’s <cite>State Trials</cite>, vol. iii. pp. 830–832,
    and also the proceedings of the Common Council, and their petition to
    the King against it. By this contrivance the King obtained a supply of
    £218,500, which he devoted to providing a fleet. Twelve of the judges
    decided that the King had the right to make the levy. In the speech of
    Lord Keeper Coventry to the judges assembled in the Star Chamber on
    the 14th of February 1636 he stated that, “In the first year, when the
    writs were directed to the ports and the maritime places, they received
    little or no opposition; but in the second year, when they went
    generally throughout the kingdom, although by some well obeyed, have
    been refused by some, not only in some inland counties, but in some of
    the maritime places.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Charles then called upon the whole nation to provide ship money.
    London was ordered to equip two more ships of 800 tons apiece. One,
    Robert Chambers by name, brought the question of the King’s right into
    the Court of the King’s Bench. Mr. Justice Berkeley, with amazing
    servility, refused to allow the case to be argued, because, he said,
    “there is a rule of law, and another of government,” thus actually
    separating the law and government. It was by this time fully evident
    that the King and Council were resolved upon the humbling of the
    City. If there was any doubt left in men’s minds, that doubt was
    surely dispelled by the action of the Star Chamber concerning the
    Irish Estates. The Star Chamber, after hearing a suit against the
    City charging them with mal-administration of their Irish property,
    condemned the City to forfeiture of all their lands in Ireland—lands
    which, as we have seen, the City had been forced to take up by James
    the First, and on which they had spent very large sums of money. In
    addition to losing their estates the citizens
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span> were fined £70,000. As
    for the fine, it was easier to inflict it than to levy it. The City
    let the Irish Estates go for the present, and paid the sum of £12,000
    in full discharge of the fine. But the thing remained in their minds,
    and one of the first acts of Parliament, when it was called, was to
    reconsider the whole question (see <a href="#Page_209">p. 209</a>).

    GEORGE VILLIERS, FIRST DUKE (SECOND CREATION) OF BUCKINGHAM (1592–1628)
    <div class="subcap">From the portrait by Gerard Honthorst.</div>
  </div>

  <p>
    I purpose in this place to interrupt the direct course of events in
    order to show, by reference to certain political events of the time,
    the mind of London.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 1626 occurred the famous impeachment of the Duke of Buckingham by
    Sir John Eliot, when the Commons pronounced their first refusal to
    grant subsidies till grievances had been redressed. Eliot was arrested
    and confined to the Tower; after ten days he was released, but the
    Parliament was dissolved. The King appealed to the country to grant as
    a free gift what the Commons had refused.
  </p>

  <p>
    The answer to this appeal should have left no doubt in the minds of
    the King’s friends that the words of Sir John Eliot stated the mind
    of the whole country. As<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
    regards London and Westminster they replied to those who would collect
    the subsidy with cries of “A Parliament! A Parliament!”
  </p>

  <p>
    Charles then tried the expedient of a forced loan with equal want of
    success. It was found impossible to collect it.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 1628 a new Parliament was called. In this House the Petition of
    Right was drawn up, in which, among other things, it was claimed that
    no man should be compelled to pay any kind of tax without the consent
    of Parliament.
  </p>

  <p>
    Charles gave way, secretly, after his manner, reserving certain rights
    of his own, as that of imprisonment without appeal. The City knew
    nothing of this duplicity; bells were rung; bonfires lighted; it was
    assumed that the King had honestly given way, and the House granted a
    subsidy. Then came the news of Buckingham’s murder.
  </p>

  <p>
    There were two of Charles’s friends, and only two, for whom the City
    afterwards entertained a hatred equal to that they felt for Buckingham.
    But at that moment there was no one whose death was so ardently
    desired. When the news was brought to London, grave citizens drank the
    health of Felton. When the murderer was brought to London, the crowd
    followed praying that the Lord would comfort him. Such was the mind
    of the City towards the man whom Eliot had impeached; they received
    the news of his murder with savage exultation. Then Charles made Laud
    Bishop of London—the third of the three men whose death a few years
    later the City welcomed with shouts of joy. It was not enough to
    trample on the liberties of the people, he must now proceed to deprive
    them of their religion. The memorable sitting in the House when the
    Speaker was held in his chair while the Commons passed resolution after
    resolution against innovations in religion and the illegal levy of
    taxes, belongs to national history. It was with passionate excitement,
    hardly restrained from tumult, that the news of this sitting and these
    resolutions was received in the City. There were as yet no newspapers
    to furnish day by day a report of the proceedings in the House, but
    the tidings of each protest of the Commons and each arbitrary measure
    of the King flew through the streets of the City as quickly as if by
    means of the daily paper, so that every house was filled with the angry
    murmurs of the citizens, and men in the streets and on ’Change looked
    at each other and asked what would happen next.
  </p>

  <p>
    Yet no word of armed resistance. The old time when one King could be
    put down and another set up in his place was forgotten. Rebellion was
    not yet even thought of. The Parliament was dissolved.
  </p>

  <p>
    Laud, free to do what he pleased, proceeded whither his pleasure
    led him. What he did is national history. The people of London, of
    whom nine-tenths were Puritans (see <a href="#Page_137">p. 137</a>), or, at least, strong
    Protestants, saw with rage the severance of the ties connecting the
    Church of England with the foreign Protestant churches; they saw the
    forcible introduction of rites and ceremonies offensive to Puritan
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
    feeling; the expulsion of Puritan clergy; the suppression of Puritan
    lectures; the prohibition of the Geneva Bible, loved by all the people;
    the desecration, as they thought, of their so-called Sabbath; the
    restoration of ritualism; the return, as they believed, to Rome.
  </p>

  <p>
    There seemed no hope of redress. The High Church party were in power;
    the return to Rome seemed certain.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was at this time (1629–1640) that the first great emigration to
    America took place. It was an emigration of men and women of every
    station and every trade; there were men of family and property among
    them; there were also husbandmen and humble craftsmen; 1700 emigrants
    went out in one year, 1630; in eleven years (1629–1640) 20,000 went
    away. It seems as if the magnitude of the emigration should have
    caused uneasiness, but probably the exodus of 2000 people a year, many
    of whom went abroad to better themselves without regard to religion,
    was considered to be useful to the plantations, and, so far as they
    departed for the sake of religion, in no way prejudicial to the State.
  </p>

  <p>
    The lists published in <cite>The Original Emigrants to America</cite> show that
    from the Port of London—the only port we need mention here—in the
    year 1635 there were embarked and were transported—not in a criminal
    sense—no fewer than 4890 emigrants, a fourth part of the whole number
    mentioned above. There must have been some special reason for the
    departure of so many in one year. We may find it, perhaps, in the
    tyrannical and oppressive proceedings of Laud. He had deprived the
    French and Flemish refugees of their right to worship after their
    own manner, and thousands emigrated in consequence; he had assumed a
    censorship of the Press which forbade such books as Foxe’s <cite>Book of
    Martyrs</cite>; he restored the “wakes” or dedication feasts, the church
    ales, the Sunday sports, the surplice, kneeling at the Communion; he
    insisted on uniformity of worship; these are sufficient causes for
    the great emigration of 1635. The book in which I find the names of
    the emigrants gives them in separate lists according to the ships in
    which they sailed; in most cases it gives their ages, in a few cases
    their occupation and station—unfortunately in very few cases. Again, in
    some cases the list gives the name of the parish where the statutory
    declaration was made, viz. the oaths of allegiance, that of conformity
    to the Church of England, and the assurance that the emigrant was not
    a “subsidy man”—that is to say, a person owing money to the State on
    account of subsidy due. One need not attach much importance to this
    declaration, as yet no one had begun to dispute the duty of allegiance;
    the Church of England included the Puritans, and as regards the
    subsidy, those who were of humble rank owed nothing; those of the
    better sort may very well have protested that they owed nothing—as by a
    strictly legal view they did not.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is a great pity that the names of the places from which the
    emigrants came are not always indicated. We cannot, for instance,
    learn how far this movement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
    affected London. Certain City parishes
    are given in which the emigrants made the statutory declaration,
    but in the majority of cases the parishes are not indicated. I have
    compiled a table, manifestly very incomplete, of those parishes which
    are mentioned. It is quite evident that many of the lists belong to
    London, though the fact is not stated. Thus there seems no reason why
    St. Katherine’s—is it St. Katherine Cree or St. Katherine Coleman, or
    St. Katherine’s by the Tower?—should have sent out 157 emigrants; St.
    Mildred’s, Bread Street, 27; and other London parishes two or three
    only.

  <p class="noindent">
    The greatest contributor, however, to the 5000 was Gravesend, from
    which place 1875 persons took the oaths and were sent on to the Port of
    London to be shipped.
  </p>

  <p>
    The sight of these crowds flocking to the Port of London to embark
    on the ships bound for America; the provisioning of the ships for
    the voyage; the talk about the places whither these persons were to
    be carried; the reasons why they went; the escape for some from the
    Laudian persecution; the hope, for others, of a new country where the
    divine right of Kings would not be a subject of discussion; the grave
    and serious divines who went on board these ships; the gentlemen who
    joined them; the humble craftsmen who went with them, the Geneva Bible
    in hand; can we doubt that these sights sank deep into the hearts of
    the people? Can we doubt that the example, the prayers, the touching
    farewells of these emigrants were sowing seeds which should produce
    fruit eventful and terrible? “Our hearts,” said Winthrop, “shall be
    fountains of tears for your everlasting welfare when we shall be in our
    poor cottages in the wilderness.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Doubt not that the people of London knew very well what a wilderness
    this New England was; how hard and barren was its coast; how cruel was
    its winter; how deadly and implacable were the Indians; they had heard
    of seasons when the shell-fish of the sea-shore were the food of the
    emigrants, when in the evening they knew not where they would find
    their food in the morning, and when they assembled to worship under
    escort and with armed sentinels.
  </p>

  <p>
    We must not be led away to believe that after the first rush, when
    divines, scholars, country gentlemen, and lawyers joined the list of
    emigrants, the same class was continued. The lists before us point
    rather in the other direction, as if in 1635, five years after the
    first movement began, by far the larger number were
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span> craftsmen and
    rustics. The age of the emigrants points to this conclusion. I have
    taken a few consecutive pages at random. I find that out of 409 names
    there were 106 under twenty; of these many were children and boys,
    but the majority were eighteen and nineteen years old; 259 were men
    and women—the men far outnumbering the women—in the full vigour of
    early manhood, namely, over twenty and under thirty. There were
    only thirty-four over forty and under fifty, and ten only of fifty
    and upwards. In other words, I conclude from these lists that while
    religion may have had a good deal to do with the emigration of this
    year, a very large part of the attraction was the thought of adventure,
    change, and better meat, which has always made the Englishman restless
    and enterprising.
  </p>

  <p>
    Where did the emigrants go? There were six places open to the emigrant
    of the seventeenth century. And he went to them in the following
    proportion during the year 1635:—

  <p>Let us return to the constitutional part of the history.</p>

  <p>
    Charles called no Parliament for eleven years. During that time, as
    he could get no subsidies, he was compelled to practise every kind
    of extortion; he enforced the old obligation to take the honour of
    knighthood; he imposed fines for encroachments, for defective title
    deeds, for recusancy.
  </p>

  <p>
    Where he touched the City was, first, in reviving the old laws against
    building in the suburbs, and in fining those living in houses built
    twenty years before in assurance that the law was a dead letter; next,
    in the levy of illegal and extortionate customs duties, which were
    resisted by the City merchants, but at their peril. One of them said
    that it was better to be a merchant in Turkey than in London; for
    this he was sent to the Tower and fined £2000: thirdly, by the system
    of monopolies, against which the City had protested under Elizabeth.
    Everything became the subject of a monopoly. As was said afterwards in
    the Long Parliament, “They sup in our cup; they dip in our dish; they
    sit by our fire; we find them in the dye-fat, the wash bowls, and the
    powdering tub. They have marked and sealed us from head to foot.”
  </p>

  <p>
    All these grievances continued to roll up like a snowball, as silently
    and as rapidly; yet it was an invisible snowball. Outwardly the King
    and his friends were deceived by the general tranquillity; there was
    offered very little resistance; there were manifested few open signs
    of discontent; a general prosperity prevailed; trade was better than
    it had been for many years; the English flag was flying over new seas
    and in ports hitherto unknown; agriculture was advancing; the country
    gentry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
    were growing more easy in their means; every one seemed quiet.
    In fact it was felt by the better class that there was no hurry. Sooner
    or later there must be a Parliament; sooner or later the makeshifts of
    the King would come to an end; there was no hurry. And the bill kept
    rolling up. But the King, and Laud, and the Court party were deceived.
    They mistook the quiet of the people, and especially of the City, for
    submission and subjection; they thought that the spirit of resistance
    was quelled.
  </p>

  <p>
    Perhaps enough has been said to show the temper of the City. One or two
    notes more.
  </p>

  <p>
    We find a London clergyman calling on all Christians to “resist the
    Bishops as robbers of souls, limbs of the Beast, and fathers of
    Antichrist.” One pays very little heed to ecclesiastical censure, which
    is generally cursing, at any time, but the vehemence of this language
    seems worthy of remark.
  </p>

  <p>
    When Prynne was carried from Palace Yard after the sentence which
    deprived him of his ears, he was escorted by a hundred thousand
    Londoners with prayers and cries of encouragement and of comfort.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 1638 Hampden’s judges laid down the principle that “no statute
    prohibiting arbitrary taxation could be pleaded against the King’s
    will.” To this monstrous doctrine the City said nothing, the people
    said nothing; they waited; sooner or later there must be a Parliament.
  </p>

  <p>
    Next year began the Scotch troubles, the beginning of the end for
    Charles.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 1640 the King found himself compelled to call a Parliament; he must
    have money.
  </p>

  <p>
    This was the Short Parliament. I am quite sure that the news of the
    summons was received on ’Change and wherever the merchants and citizens
    of London met together with the quiet laughter of those who saw that
    the day of redemption was drawing nigh. At last after eleven years
    the Parliament was called together. Would the members prove staunch?
    No fear of that. The City knew—no other institution or place knew so
    well—the feeling of the country. The City always knew the feeling of
    the country; there were a thousand correspondents between the City and
    the country; the merchants had no doubt that the country was sound.
    Laud’s clergy marked the change in the defiant air of the City, in the
    exulting looks of the people; there were changes close at hand.
  </p>

  <p>
    The House did prove staunch. Once more the Commons refused a subsidy
    till grievances were redressed, and until security was obtained for
    religion, for property, and for the liberties of the country. The
    House was dissolved. Then the City laughed again and its people rubbed
    their hands. For the King must have money, and without a Parliament he
    could not get money. The Scotch business went on, and the snowball of
    discontent and of grievances was now visible even to Charles the Blind.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span></p>

  <p>
    Then began an interesting and an exciting time. The King tried to
    persuade the City to lend him £100,000. The City steadfastly refused.
    The Mayor and Aldermen were summoned to Whitehall; the King addressed
    them; they were ordered to make out lists of the wealthier citizens;
    they were dismissed, but were summoned again, and told that if they
    did not pay £100,000 they would have to pay £200,000; and that if
    they still refused that they would have to pay £300,000. They were
    again dismissed, and told to prepare the list of rich citizens by the
    following Sunday.

      <div class="subcap">From a satirical print in the British Museum.</div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    By this time the temper of London was roused. The Mayor and Aldermen
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
    came on the following Sunday, but without that list. Instead
    they brought a petition asking for redress. Some of them refused
    absolutely to make out such a list, and were committed to prison,
    viz. Sir Nicholas Rainton to the Marshalsea, Alderman Somers to the
    Fleet, Alderman Atkins to the King’s Bench, and Alderman Gayre to
    the Gatehouse. It was on Sunday, the 10th of May, that the Aldermen
    went to prison. The reply of the City was a tumult, in which the
    Archbishop’s Palace at Lambeth was attacked and the Archbishop’s life
    was threatened. A royal warrant was issued commanding the Lord Mayor to
    raise as many men as might be needed for the suppression of riots. At
    the same time it was thought best to let the Aldermen go.
  </p>

  <p>
    In June the Mayor was again summoned to show cause why the ship money
    was not collected. He replied, plainly, that no one would pay it. Here
    we see the secret of the City’s strength; the people only had to sit
    down; they could not be forced to pay, either by the King, who had
    no force at his disposal, or by the Aldermen, who had no police. The
    people sat down and refused to pay. There were threats of debasing
    the coinage unless the City yielded; the answer was that the Common
    Council had no power to dispose of the citizens’ money. Charles
    then endeavoured to raise £120,000 from the livery companies; they
    replied—it was impossible to let go so fine an opportunity—that their
    “stocks” had all been consumed in the Irish Estates—confiscated by the
    King.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the 3rd of November 1640 Charles, evidently suffering under great
    depression of spirits, opened the Long Parliament.
  </p>

  <p>
    Between the dissolution of the Short Parliament and the assembling of
    the Long the City petitioned the King to call a Parliament for the
    redress of grievances. Laud and the Privy Council tried to frighten the
    City against signing it, but in vain. It was signed by 10,000 citizens.
    Maitland gives it in full:—
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“<span class="smcap">Most Gracious Sovereign</span>—</p>

    <p>
      Being moved with the Duty and Obedience, which by the Laws your
      Petitioners owe unto your sacred Majesty, they humbly present unto
      your princely and pious Wisdom the several pressing Grievances
      following, viz.—
    </p>

    <p>
      1. The pressing and unusual Impositions upon Merchandize,
      importing and exporting, and the urging and levying of Ship-Money,
      notwithstanding both which, Merchants’ Ships and Goods have been
      taken and destroyed both by Turkish and other Pirates.
    </p>

    <p>
      2. The Multitude of Monopolies, Patents, and Warrants, whereby
      Trade in the City, and other Parts of the Kingdom is much decayed.
    </p>

    <p>3. The sundry Innovations in Matters of Religion.</p>

    <p>
      4. The Oath and Canons lately enjoined by the late Convocation,
      whereby your Petitioners are in Danger to be deprived of their
      Ministers.
    </p>

    <p>
      5. The Great Concourse of Papists, and their Inhabitations
      in London, and the Suburbs, whereby they have more Means and
      Opportunity of plotting and executing their designs against the
      Religion established.
    </p>

    <p>
      6. The seldom Calling, and sudden Dissolutions of Parliaments,
      without the redress of your Subjects’ Grievances.
    </p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span></p>

    <p>
      7. The Imprisonment of divers Citizens for Non-payment of
      Ship-Money, and Impositions; and the prosecution of many others in
      the Star-Chamber, for not conforming themselves to Committees in
      Patents of Monopolies, whereby Trade is restrained.
    </p>

    <p>
      8. The great Danger your sacred Person is exposed unto in
      the present War, and the various fears that seized upon your
      Petitioners and their Families by reason thereof; which Grievances
      and Fears have occasioned so great a stop and distraction in Trade,
      that your Petitioners can neither buy, sell, receive, or pay as
      formerly, and tends to the utter Ruin of the Inhabitants of this
      City, the Decay of Navigation, and Clothing, and the Manufactures
      of this Kingdom.

  <p>
    The fanatical temper of the people as regards the Catholics was shown
    in their attack upon the Spanish Ambassador’s house in Bishopsgate
    Street:—
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “Upon the twenty-ninth of April the first tumultuous disorder (of
      these Times) happened in London, when a great number of Apprentices
      and others beset the Spanish Ambassador’s house in Bishopsgate
      Street, threatening to pull it down, and to kill the Ambassador,
      for permitting English papists to frequent his Chapel. For the
      appeasing of this Commotion, the Lord-Mayor immediately repaired
      to the Ambassador’s,
      where with much difficulty he prevailed
      upon the Populace to disperse and return home. His Lordship had
      no sooner allayed the fury of the Multitude, than he entered the
      Ambassador’s House, and, being met by that Minister, was desired
      to drop the point of the City Sword that was carried before him,
      acquainting him, That he was then in a Place where the King of
      Spain, his Master, had Jurisdiction; which the Mayor complying
      with, the Ambassador told him that he had never seen so barbarous
      an attempt; and desired to know whether this could justly be called
      a civilized Nation, where the Laws of Nations and Hospitality were
      so horribly violated? The Mayor replied, That the Rioters were the
      very Refuse of the People, therefore entreated his Excellency not
      to impute the Sedition to the City: to which the Ambassador smartly
      answered, That he hardly knew how to call that a City, or even a
      Society of Rational Creatures, which was seemingly divested both of
      Humanity and Government.

      The Mayor, to extenuate the Crime as much as possible, told the

      at Madrid enjoyed the free Exercise of his Religion without the
      least Disturbance; and that he would rather choose to lose his
      Life than the Privileges due to him by Contract and the Law of
      Nations: the Mayor returned, That the People were the more incensed
      against him because the Citizens of the Popish Communion were
      permitted to frequent his House at Mass, contrary to Law: The
      Ambassador answered, That if the Mayor would prevent their coming,
      he would not fend for them; but, if they came, he could neither
      in Conscience to his Religion, nor his Master’s Honour, deny them
      Access to their Devotions, or Protection to their Persons, while
      they were with him. Wherefore a Guard was placed at his House,
      which not only protected him from further Insults, but likewise the
      Popish Citizens from frequenting Mass.

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      This Storm was no sooner over than another far more impetuous
      began; for a Discovery being made of some desperate Designs both
      at home and abroad, of bringing up the Army to London to surprise
      the Tower, and favour the Earl of Strafford’s escape, divers
      Ministers from their Pulpits, on the Sunday following, shewed to
      their several Auditories the Necessity of having Justice speedily
      executed upon some great Delinquents; which so greatly irritated
      and inflamed the Citizens, that the Day after they, to the Number
      of Six Thousand, armed with Swords, Staves, and Cudgels, ran to
      Westminster; and posting themselves in the Avenues leading to the
      House of Lords, stopped all Coaches, and incessantly cried out for
      Justice against Strafford.”
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    We now come to events which belong to the national history. We may
    therefore pass them over except where they specially touch upon London.
  </p>

  <p>
    The discovery of the “Army Plot” made Strafford’s fate certain, and
    his death was the cause of savage exultation in the City; a countless
    multitude assembled to see him die; the people ran and rode from the
    scene waving their hats and crying “His head is off.”
  </p>

  <p>
    The Grand Remonstrance laid before the House called forth the
    opposition of a small Royalist party, which only strengthened the
    cause. London was zealous for the cause; associations were formed in
    every county. I pass over the events which followed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Civil War began in July 1642. Marston Moor in 1644 and Naseby in 1645
    practically finished it.
  </p>

  <p>
    The importance of the City in making the war possible can hardly be
    overestimated. They began with a force of 8000 trained bands, well
    drilled and well handled. When the breach between King and Commons
    could no longer be averted, the City raised £100,000 with alacrity at
    the request of the latter. An immense quantity of plate was brought in,
    and a levy of £50,000 was laid upon all strangers and aliens residing
    in the City. That was in June 1642. When in the autumn it was reported
    that Prince Rupert was marching on London, the City became a huge camp;
    nothing went on but arming, training, practising, marching. The whole
    City was Roundhead; those few who remained loyal—the “malignants”—were
    arrested and clapped into prison as soon as they could be caught. This
    unanimity did not continue. The Royalists presently plucked up heart
    and, appearing with their badges, found out how strong they were.
    A reaction set in when it was discovered that the war would not be
    finished in a single campaign and that it entailed heavy sacrifices,
    including the shutting of shops and the temporary ruin of trade. A
    stormy gathering was held in the Guildhall, at which there were loud
    cries for peace. The Common Council therefore drew up two petitions,
    one for the King and one for the Parliament, advocating peace, or at
    least a truce for deliberation.
  </p>

  <p>
    They even sent a deputation to the King, who received the members
    graciously and promised a reply, which quickly followed. It is a very
    long document, in which the King pointed out the wickedness of fighting
    against him; and he ordered his loyal subjects to begin the cause of
    peace by arresting the Mayor.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span></p>

  <p>
    On the 21st of November 1642, about a month after the battle of
    Edgehill, a suspicious-looking boat was discovered by the pinnace
    guarding the Thames for the City and Parliament. She was a Gravesend
    boat and should have put in at Billingsgate. Instead of this, the tide
    being favourable, she continued her course and shot the bridge. The
    pinnace gave chase, and presently caught up with her and seized her.
    The only passenger on board was a gentleman, who was carrying from
    Colonel Goring a letter—it is not stated to whom—containing lists of
    the supplies of men expected by the King from Holland and Denmark.
    Nothing could have been more opportune than such a capture; the City
    was still lukewarm in the cause; to afford them clear proof that
    the King intended to fight them with Danes and Dutchmen would fire
    their blood as nothing else would do, not even defeat and disaster.
    Pennington, who was Mayor and a Parliamentarian heart and soul,
    joyfully received the letter, ordered copies to be made and to be
    read in every church on Sunday, the very next day, and a subscription
    to be opened at once for carrying on the war. In the church of St.
    Bartholomew by the Exchange, twenty-seven persons subscribed various
    sums, amounting in all to £290. In St. Margaret’s, Lothbury, about
    £350 were subscribed. Mr. Edwin Freshfield, who relates this story
    (<cite>Archæologia</cite>, xlv.), is of opinion that the whole business was
    invented by the Mayor. He wanted money, he wanted to rouse the
    citizens, he wanted them to be committed openly. In this he succeeded
    perfectly; he raised £30,000, he fired their passions, he made them
    commit themselves in writing. From this moment there was no looking
    back for the City of London.
  </p>

  <p>
    In February 1643, as the attack upon London by the Royalist army seemed
    threatening, the Common Council passed an Act for the defence of the
    City by a line of redoubts and fortifications, which were taken in
    hand and executed without delay. It has been assumed that this work
    consisted of a wall with redoubts and bastions at intervals. A plan of
    the wall shows an enormous work, eleven miles long, running all round
    London. This view has been adopted by later writers. No one seems to
    have remarked on the impossibility of so colossal a fortification being
    constructed in the brief space of three or four weeks even if the whole
    population worked day and night; and no one seems to have discovered
    that it was absurd to construct such a wall where the enemy could not
    possibly attack it, or that it should have been thought desirable to
    construct a wall which it would have required at least 200,000 men to
    defend. The historian also might have thought it still more remarkable
    that such enormous earth-works, with stone bastions, entailing such
    enormous labour, should have been undertaken with so much zeal and
    unanimity; and, finally, he might have asked himself how it came to
    pass that not a vestige of the work should have remained, even though
    the greater part of the ground covered was free from buildings down to
    the beginning of this century.

  <p>
    Sharpe, however (<cite>London and the Kingdom</cite>, iii. 431), gives the actual
    “Resolution of the Common Council for putting the City and Suburbs into
    a posture of defence, 23rd February 1643:”—
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“<cite>Journal</cite> 40, fo. 52.</p>

      <p>
      That a small fort conteyning one bulwark and halfe and a battery in
      the reare of the flanck be made at Gravell lane end. A horne worke
      with two flanckers be placed at Whitechapell windmills. One redoubt
      with two flanckers betwixt Whitechapel Church and Shoreditch. Two
      redoubts with flanckers neere Shoreditch church with a battery. At
      the windmill in Islington way, a battery and brestwork round about.
      A small redoubt neere Islington pound. A battery and brestwork on
      the hill neere Clarkenwell towards Hampstead way. Two batteries and
      a brestworke at Southampton House. One redoubt with two flanckers
      by St. Giles in the Fields, another small worke neere the turning.
      A quadrant forte with fower halfe bulwarks crosse Tyborne highway
      at the second turning that goeth towards Westminster. At Hide parke
      corner a large forte with flanckers on all sides. At the corner of
      the lord Gorings brick wall next the fields a redoubt and a battery
      where the Court of Guard now is at the lower end of the lord
      Gorings wall, the brestwork to be made forwarder. In Tuttle fields
      a battery brestworke, and the ditches to be scowred. That at the

      passages into the suburbs on the north side the river except five,
      viz.: the way from St. James towards Charing Crosse, the upper end
      of Saint Giles in Holborne, the further end of St. John Street
      towards Islington, Shoreditch church, and Whitechapell be stopped
      up. That the courtes of guard and the rayles or barrs at the utmost
      partes of the freedome be made defensible, and turnpikes placed
      there in lieu of the chaynes all muskett proof. And that all the
      shedds and buildings that joyne to the outside of the wall be taken
      downe. And that all the bulwarkes be fitted at the gates and walls
      soe that the flanckes of the wall and streets before the gates
      may be cleared and that the gates and bulwarkes be furnished with
      ordnance.”
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    It will be seen that there is not one word about a new wall round
    London. The so-called fortifications were simply small redoubts and
    bastions at certain fixed points.
  </p>

  <p>
    How the London trained bands went out to fight, how well they stood
    their ground, in what actions they took their part, will be found in
    the many histories of that war which still claims its fierce adherents
    and still awakens the passions of a partisan, whoever relates it. The
    constancy of the City was rewarded by the stoppage of trade and the
    ruin of many merchants, while the soldiers in the trained bands were
    shopkeepers and skilled craftsmen, to whom long continuance in the
    field was ruin. In 1644 the disaffection of the men amounted almost to
    mutiny.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the temper and discipline of the City trained bands Sharpe thus
    speaks:—
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “That the city trained bands had done good service in their day
      no one will deny, but the time was fast approaching when it would
      be necessary to raise an army of men willing to devote themselves
      to the military life as a profession. For permanent service in
      the field the London trained bands were not to be relied on. ‘In
      these two days’ march,’ wrote Waller (2 July) to the Committee
      of Both Kingdoms, ‘I was extremely plagued with the mutinies of
      the City Brigade, who are grown to that height of disorder that
      I have no hope to retain them, being come to their old song of
      “Home! Home!”’ There was, he said, only one remedy for this, and
      that was a standing army, however small:—‘My lords, I write these
      particulars to let you know that an army compounded of these men
      will never go through with your service, and till you have an army
      merely your own, that you may command, it is in a manner impossible
      to do <span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
      anything of importance.’ The junction of his forces with
      those under Browne, who had been despatched (23 June) to protect
      the country between London and the royalist army, served only to
      increase the general discontent. ‘My London regiments,’ he wrote
      (8 July), ‘immediately looked on his [<i xml:lang="la">i.e.</i> Browne’s] forces as
      sent to relieve them, and without expectation of further orders,
      are most of them gone away; yesterday no less than 400 out of one
      regiment quitted their colours. On the other side, Major-General
      Browne’s men, being most of them trained band men of Essex and
      Hertfordshire, are so mutinous and uncommandable that there is
      no hope of their stay. They are likewise upon their march home
      again. Yesterday they were like to have killed their Major-General,
      and they have hurt him in the face.... I am confident that above
      2000 Londoners ran away from their colours.’ The same spirit of
      insubordination manifested itself again when Waller threw himself
      (20 July) into Abingdon. Most of his troops were only too anxious
      to leave him, whilst the Londoners especially refused to stir ‘one
      foot further, except it be home.’”

  <p>
    The City, however, despite these rules, remained staunch to the
    Parliamentary cause; in spite of hard times, London raised the money to
    carry on the war; and, as in former cases, the winning side proved to
    be that which London had espoused.
  </p>

  <p>
    Early in 1645 the army was remodelled on a more permanent footing,
    in which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
    the men were to receive regular pay and the officers to
    be appointed for efficiency alone. Parliament resolved on borrowing
    £80,000 of the City; the Committee of Militia raised a sufficient
    number of men to guard the new redoubts and forts, and the City
    regiments were brought up to their full strength.
  </p>

  <p>
    In June 1645 the Common Council presented a petition to Parliament
    calling attention to what they considered the causes of their ill
    success, and asking, among other things, that Fairfax might have a
    free hand and not be hampered by orders from Westminster. This view
    was favourably received. Fairfax chose his own tactics; he marched in
    pursuit of the Royal army, which he met—and fought—at Naseby on June 14.
  </p>

  <p>
    After Naseby the City entertained both Houses of Parliament with a
    Thanksgiving sermon in Christ Church, Newgate. This was the old Grey
    Friars Church, a splendid building then still standing, though its
    monuments and fine carved work were gone. After the sermon there was a
    banquet in Grocers’ Hall; the Hall was not large enough for everybody,
    therefore the Common Council dined at another Company’s hall. The day
    after the dinner the Council had to consider what was to be done with
    the 3000 Royalist prisoners. They confined them in the south cloister
    and the Convocation House of St. Paul’s. How long they were kept there;
    how they were fed; what became of them ultimately, one knows not.
    Perhaps they were treated as Cromwell afterwards treated the Scotch
    prisoners taken at Worcester (see <a href="#Page_68">p. 68</a>).
  </p>

  <p>
    The City also raised £31,000 for the pay of the Scots who were marching
    south. In July of the same year they raised 1000 light horse and 500
    dragoons, and in September 500 light horse and the same number of
    dragoons.
  </p>

  <p>
    The events which followed Naseby until the trial and execution of the
    King would not concern us but for the part played by the City. They
    constitute a chapter in which the completion of the Civil War is mixed
    up with the dissension of the Presbyterians and the Independents,
    two sects equally intolerant and equally determined to obtain the
    supremacy. I have abridged the business so far as the City is concerned
    in the paragraph which follows. The whole story, when one reads it in
    detail, makes one almost inclined to condone the crimes of the King
    against the civil liberties of the people, since his enemies were
    themselves so determined against their religious liberties.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Parliament desired to force a Presbyterian form of worship on the
    City, and to lay down laws for the election of elders. This was not
    at all the view of the City, which desired freedom from Parliamentary
    control in matters of religion. The ministers of the City parish
    churches drew up their own list of reforms; the citizens themselves
    sent a petition to Parliament giving their views. The House of Commons
    returned an answer of an ungracious character. They knew their own
    duties and would carry them through.
  </p>

      TRIAL OF KING CHARLES I., JANUARY 1648

  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span></p>

  <p>
    The City at the same time came to a quarrel with Parliament on the
    governing of the militia raised within the weekly bills of mortality.
    Parliament was ready to allow them the command over the militia
    within the Liberties, but the City wished to include within the area
    of command all the parishes and parts covered by the weekly bills of
    mortality.
  </p>

  <p>
    The three years preceding the execution of Charles were a troubled and
    an uneasy time for the City.
  </p>

  <p>
    On September the 7th, 1646, the City was asked by Parliament to
    consider ways and means for raising £200,000, being half of the sum
    claimed by the Scots for their expenses. On the 9th they reported a
    scheme for raising money by the excise and by the sale of the Bishop’s
    lands.
  </p>

  <p>
    On December 19th the City sent a petition to Parliament for the
    redress of grievances. They demanded the disbandment of the army, the
    suppression of heresy, the union of the two kingdoms, the free election
    of members of Parliament, and the command of their own militia. The
    “disbandment of the army” is a point that must be especially noted
    because it marks the growing terror of the army.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was necessary, before the army could be disbanded, to settle
    the arrears of pay. The men were invited to volunteer for service
    in Ireland. They asked for their pay. Parliament proposed to raise
    £200,000, not for the arrears, but for service in England and Ireland.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the same time application was made to the City for ways and means
    to raise this large sum. And the City was put into good temper by an
    ordinance for a new Militia Committee.
  </p>

  <p>
    But the disbanded army had to look on while they themselves could
    get no pay, and the City militia received their pay regularly. Riots
    took place; companies of the disbanded besieged the House of Commons
    demanding their arrears. These riots took place early in June 1647.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the 11th of June the City was informed that Fairfax, with the army,
    was on his way to London. The Mayor replied that they had no quarrel
    with the army; that they had themselves presented a humble address
    to Parliament in favour of the just demands of the army; and that if
    Fairfax would kindly keep at a distance of thirty miles, the City would
    be much obliged.
  </p>

  <p>
    Fairfax declared that the last demand was impossible so long as
    enlistments were continued in the trained bands and auxiliaries, and
    that the movements of the army depended very much on the reception that
    might be given to certain papers just laid before the House of Lords.
    The “papers,” in fact, asserted the right of the army to speak in the
    name of the people, and demanded the expulsion from the House of eleven
    members who had misrepresented the army and raised forces for a new
    war. Among them was Glyn, the City Recorder.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span></p>

  <p>
    The Mayor, Sir John Gayre, on finding that the army was really marching
    south, called out the newly-enlisted trained bands. It appeared that
    they only existed on paper; in many companies not ten men appeared;
    in many others none but officers. It became evident that a different
    tone must be adopted. Fairfax was assured that the new enlistments had
    been stopped. Even then that general was not satisfied. He now said
    that he could not stop his army until the Parliament had returned a
    satisfactory answer to the “papers” already mentioned. The sending
    of these letters backwards and forwards produced little effect for a
    time—except tumults of apprentices and disturbances by <i xml:lang="es">reformadoes</i>,
    or disbanded soldiers.

      <div class="subcap">From the painting by William Dobson in the National Portrait Gallery, London.</div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    On July 9th the Parliament agreed to the demands of Fairfax, and
    ordered all disbanded soldiers to quit the City. On July 11th the
    Army Council recommended the Parliament to take into their own hands
    again the command of the City militia. This was done, but the City had
    their say in the matter. Petitions to the House were drawn up; they
    were carried to Westminster by the sheriffs and members of the Common
    Council, followed by an enormous crowd of angry and excited apprentices
    and citizens. There was a long debate; the Commons refused to give
    way; the crowd grew more threatening; at last, at eight o’clock in the
    evening, the Commons yielded.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span></p>

  <p>
    It was now time for the City to consider measures of defence. The
    trained bands were sent to man the works, and all the citizens who
    could carry arms were ordered to attend at a general muster. It became
    obvious, however, that armed resistance to the army was out of the
    question, and the City made haste to submit and to hope for favourable
    terms. The City forts were surrendered. Fairfax entered the lines of
    fortification and marched upon Westminster. On the following day the
    army marched through the City doing no kind of harm to any one. Fairfax
    and his officers were invited to a grand banquet at Grocers’ Hall, and
    so the business ended amicably, as it seemed.
  </p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    The banquet did not interfere, however, with the projects of Fairfax
    and the army. The City was called upon for £50,000 towards the arrears
    of pay; the Lord Mayor, Sir John Gayre, Thomas Cullons, one of the
    Sheriffs, and three Aldermen were impeached for threatening the Commons
    and for inciting to fresh war. They were all sent to the Tower. When
    they were brought for trial before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
    the Lords, they refused to kneel,
    took exception to the jurisdiction of the Houses, and were all fined
    and committed again to the Tower, where they lay for two months more,
    when they were liberated.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 1648 the City carried one point and gained the command of their own
    militia. A deputation of Lords and Commons attended the Court of Common
    Council, and assured them that not only did they cheerfully commit to
    them the command of the militia, but that they had resolved on making
    no change in the constitution of the country with King, Lords, and
    Commons. The City at this juncture resolved to stand by the Parliament;
    they asked for the return of the Recorder, the Aldermen, and the other
    citizens who were imprisoned in the Tower.
  </p>

  <p>
    The miserable condition of trade naturally brought about discontent,
    which turned to disaffection. The Royalist party made an excuse of
    a rising in Kent to petition the Parliament for a personal treaty
    with the King; the same people also called upon the Court of Common
    Council to summon a Common Hall—that is, a meeting of the whole body of
    freemen. The Court took time to consider the matter: in other words,
    to see their way to refusing it, which they did at last, on the ground
    of the distraction of the times. The longing for peace was shown by
    petition after petition from the City, all in the same strain, that the
    King should be approached personally; the City offered to assure his
    safety if he were placed in their hands.
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition to the other troubles, the mob was now growing more
    Royalist. They insulted the Speaker; they rescued war prisoners; they
    secretly enlisted and sent out horses for the Royalist enemy. The
    Council asked the House that a death penalty should be inflicted on any
    person who caused a tumult or riot, and that no man who had ever fought
    against the Parliament should be allowed to reside within thirty miles
    of London. These two requests reveal a time of great uneasiness and
    general suspicion.
  </p>

  <p>
    The end of this state of things was now rapidly approaching. The
    Parliament sent fifteen commissioners to open the Treaty of Newport in
    September. At the end of November the army declared that the Parliament
    must be dissolved. Fairfax marched into London (November 30, 1648) and
    demanded a sum of £40,000 to be paid the next day. The Council sent
    him £10,000 and promised the rest; Fairfax took up his quarters at
    Whitehall, and sent into the City for 3800 beds. A week later, neither
    money nor beds having been provided, Fairfax arrested Major-General
    Browne, one of the sheriffs, with certain others, on a charge of having
    joined in calling upon the Scots to invade England. He also seized
    on the sum of £27,000 lying in Goldsmiths’ and Weavers’ Halls. This
    money, he told the City, he intended to keep until they sent him the
    £40,000. He refused meantime to withdraw his troops who were quartered
    on the City. The money was found. In the municipal elections the new
    Mayor, Abraham Reynardson, was a Royalist,
    and well known to be
    such. It was feared by the Commons, now the Rump, that the elections
    of December to the Common Council would also be Royalist. Accordingly
    the House passed an ordinance excluding “malignants.” In this way no
    citizen was admitted who had subscribed to any petition for a personal
    treaty with the King. When the new Council assembled, the Mayor ordered
    them to take the oath of allegiance, which had not yet been abolished.
    This they refused. The Commons ordered the Mayor to suspend the oath
    altogether. Under these conditions the Council met, and although
    the Mayor refused to acknowledge their authority, they proceeded to
    consider a petition asking the House “to execute justice impartially
    and vigorously ‘upon all the grand and capital authors, contrivers of
    and actors in the late wars against Parliament and kingdom, from the
    highest to the lowest,’ and to take steps, as the supreme power of the
    nation, for the preservation of peace and the recovery of trade and
    credit.”

    The Royalist Lord Mayor with his Aldermen—only two being present—rose
    and left the Court rather than sanction such a petition by their
    presence. It must be remembered that the date of this meeting was the
    18th of January 1648, and that the Court for the trial of Charles had
    been already determined. When the Mayor and Aldermen had left there
    was no Court. But those present proceeded with their petition. Among
    the judges of King Charles were nominated five Aldermen, viz. Isaac
    Pennington, Thomas Andrews, Thomas Atkins, Rowland Wilson, and John
    Fowke. Only the two first took part in the trial, and Wilson refused
    to serve. Bradshaw, the President, had been judge of the Sheriffs’
    Court in the Wood Street Compter. Two citizens, Tichborne and Row,
    were on the Commission. The trial of Charles—the most momentous in its
    consequences of any event since the Conquest or the granting of the
    Great Charter—belongs to the national history. It began on the 20th
    of January; it concluded on the 27th; and on the 30th the King was
    beheaded.

    </h3>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">
    <span class="smcap">The</span> City entered upon a war which was to linger on for eight years,
    in the firm conviction that it would be finished in a few months. The
    men who went out to fight expected to be back again in their shops
    and their workrooms before long. This belief, while it stimulated the
    enlistment of fighting men and forbade the contemplation of distress
    and bankruptcy in case the war should continue, caused very grave
    discontent when it became evident that a long struggle was before the
    country.
  </p>

  <p>
    I propose in this chapter to illustrate the condition of the City
    during this period from contemporary authorities not, I hope, already
    too well known.
  </p>

  <p>
    As is natural at such a time, the City was full of dangers on account
    of suspicion. The experiences of James Howell when he was arrested as a
    spy show how perilous it was to go abroad in the streets:—
  </p>

  <p>
    “I was lately come to London upon some occasions of mine own, and I
    had been divers times in Westminster Hall, where I conversed with many
    Parliament-men of my Acquaintance, but one morning betimes there rushed
    into my Chamber five armed Men with Swords, Pistols, and Bills, and
    told me they had a warrant from the Parliament for me; I desired to
    see their Warrant, they denied it; I desired to see the date of it,
    they denied it; I desired to see my Name in the Warrant, they denied
    all. At last one of them pulled a greasy Paper out of his pocket,
    and shewed me only three or four names subscribed, and no more; so
    they rushed presently into my Closet, and seized on all my Papers and
    Letters, and anything that was Manuscript; and many printed Books they
    took also, and hurl’d all into a great hair Trunk which they carried
    away with them. I had taken a little Physic that morning, and with
    very much ado they suffered me to stay in my Chamber with two Guards
    upon me, till the evening; at which time they brought me before the
    Committee for examination, where I confess I found good respect; and
    being brought up to the Close Committee for examination, I was ordered
    to be forthcoming, till some papers of mine were perused, and Mr.
    Corbet was appointed to do it. Some days after, I came to Mr. Corbet,
    and he told me he had perused them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
    and could find nothing that might
    give offence. Hereupon I desired him to make a report to the House,
    according to which (as I was told) he did very fairly; yet such was
    my hard Hap, that I was committed to the Fleet, where I am now under
    close restraint; and, as far as I see, I must lie at dead Anchor in
    this Fleet, a long time, unless some gentle Gale blow thence to make me
    launch out.”
  </p>

  <p>
    How the war affected quiet and peaceful citizens may be gathered from
    two cases, instanced by Dugdale:—
  </p>

  <p>
    “The miseries and calamities which of late have happened in this
    confused place of England are so many that they furnish the discourse
    both of this and of other nations, who, notwithstanding, are not able
    to express them all. I shall now relate you only two, befalling within
    these few days, and to this end, that, by the true report of these
    (which, by men of sundry passions, may be prevented), others of the
    like nature, if it please God, may be prevented. Of the one, I have
    certaine information; of the other, I myselfe was an eye-witness.
    The first happened, at Acton, some six miles distant from London,
    where lived a gentleman, reported and believed to be different in
    religion (as too many nowadays are, which we know to be the cause of
    all our evils) from the Church of England; but in the voice of most
    of his neighbours, a sober, moderate, and charitable-minded man. This
    gentleman, having in his house no more but one ancient gentlewoman, his
    kinswoman, whom he intrusted as his housekeeper, with one serving man
    and maide, had his house besett with divers companies of soldiers, who
    had listed themselves for the service of the King and Parliament, and
    were in pay and command under officers; where, after they had forced
    him to open the gates by threatning words, they entered the house,
    and so strangely despoiled him that they left him not a bed, bedstead,
    table, doore, or glasse window, chest, trunk, or the smallest utensil,
    but sold all for very small prices before his servants’ faces, some of
    them having forced him before on foote to London; and for his bills,
    bonds, letters, and other writings the most part they tore in pieces,
    and strewed them about the house; others some they sent up to London.
    He hath, with much industry and long time, rarely furnished a plot of
    ground with the choicest flowers and outlandish trees which he could
    procure, which they plucked up by the roots, as many as they could, and
    the rest left so desolate that, whereas it was thought the finest and
    most curious garden in all those parts, there is now left nothing but
    the ruines of Art and Nature.
  </p>

  <p>
    The other outrage, which with griefe I saw, was committed in Radcliffe
    Highway, Tuesday last, being the 23 of this instant August, where lived
    an ancient gentleman in good fashion, love and credit amongst his
    neighbours for many years space. I was informed, and might likewise
    guesse by his aspect, that he was above fourscore, and his wife not
    much distant from his time. This poor man was, like manner, assaulted
    by another company of souldiers, who are billeted thereabouts until the
    drum commands them to do service, where, having approached his doore,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
    they drew out a paper, which they read,—whether a pretense of authority
    or what else I cannot easily conjecture. And thereupon they rushed
    into the house, rifled him of all that was in the house, breaking and
    battering many of the goods, and, having brought them out, sold them
    to such persons as would buy them at any rates, and this at noone day,
    and in the sight of one thousand people: one feather-bed I saw sold
    for four shillings, and one flock-bed for one shilling; and many other
    things at I know not what prises, leaving him nothing but naked walls
    and one stoole, which the old man sate upon, he being lame and decrepit
    with old age. The head-borough of the place endeavoured to rescue some
    of the goods, which were afterwards violently taken againe out of his
    house. After the riot was thus ended, they marched away with a drum;
    and then I made bold to goe into this distressed man’s house, where I
    found him sitting upon his only stoole, and with the teares falling
    downe his hoary beard, from whence, having administered the best
    comfort that I could, I departed.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Before long it became manifest that the war was pressing very severely
    upon the City. The complaints of all classes were deep and loud; there
    arose the inevitable reaction. It seemed at one time as if history
    was about to repeat itself and that the desertion of London by the
    Britons in the fifth century, owing to the stoppage of supplies, was
    about to be repeated in the seventeenth. There was no foreign trade;
    the Royalist ships commanded the German Ocean; the west of England
    sent up no wool; the east sent up no provisions; the north sent up no
    coal; there was no money; the shops stood open, but the master was
    away with the trained bands; the craftsman’s children wanted bread,
    but the breadwinner was away with Fairfax. The industries ceased,
    for the markets were closed; after every battle, soldiers, either
    disbanded or deserters, swarmed into London as a place of refuge; the
    Royalist minority was a constant source of danger; there were religious
    differences innumerable, each as intolerant as the Church of Rome; the
    citizens were, for the most part, Presbyterian; but they desired not
    to have a national, but a free, Church; they wanted the Church to be
    governed by herself, and not by Parliament; they petitioned Parliament
    in this sense; they also petitioned the House for intolerance pure and
    simple; they would have no freedom of thought, or speech, or doctrine
    in religion.
  </p>

  <p>
    To take instances of hardship. In 1642 the people in the Strand, who
    chiefly lived by letting lodgings, were in despair, having to pawn
    their furniture in order to pay the rent, their lodgings being all
    empty. The lawyers at the Guildhall were busy, but it was over the
    affairs of an incredible number of bankrupts; at the Royal Exchange
    there was no business transacted, nor any discourse all day long except
    about the news of the day. In the shops the keepers had nothing to do
    but to visit and to condole with each other. London, as it always had
    been, was a receiving house and a distributing house for the whole
    country, and in this time of civil war there was nothing to distribute
    and nothing to receive. As a finishing stroke, it is
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span> added that
    the ladies who formed the greater part of the population of Covent
    Garden, Drury Lane, and Long Acre were reduced to a condition which is
    described in a tract of the time as a “lump of amazement.” For this
    quarter and these ladies existed not by the citizens, though the morals
    of the City were by no means without reproach, but by the visitors who
    in quiet times flocked to London.
  </p>

  <p>
    Amid a confused babble of petitions and letters, and imprisonments and
    fines, one episode stands out clear and strong. It is the petition of
    the women, calling themselves “many civilly disposed women,” to the
    Parliament, praying for a peace. The petition was cleverly drawn up—one
    suspects a masculine hand:—
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “That your Petitioners (tho’ of the weaker Sex) do too sensibly
      perceive the ensuing Desolation of this Kingdom, unless by some
      timely Means your Honours provide for the Speedy Recovery thereof.
      Your Honours are the Physicians that can, by God’s special and
      miraculous Blessing (which we humbly implore), restore this
      languishing Nation, and our bleeding Sister the kingdom of Ireland,
      which hath now almost breathed her last Gasp.
    </p>

    <p>
      We need not dictate to your Eagle-eyed Judgements the Way; Our
      only Desire is, that God’s Glory, in the true Reformed Protestant
      Religion, may be preserved, the just Prerogatives and Privileges of
      King and Parliament maintained, the true Liberties and Properties
      of the Subject, according to the known Laws of the Land, restored,
      and all honourable Ways and Means for a speedy Peace endeavoured.
    </p>

    <p>
      May it therefore please your Honours, that some speedy Course
      may be taken for the Settlement of the true Reformed Protestant
      Religion, for the Glory of God, and the Renovation of Trade, for
      the Benefit of the Subject, they being the Soul and Body of the
      Kingdom.
    </p>

    <p>
      And your Petitioners, with many Millions of afflicted Souls,
      groaning under the Burden of these Times of Distress, shall (as
      bound) pray, etc.”
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    It was taken to Westminster by two or three thousand women with white
    ribbons in their hats. The Commons received and heard the petition;
    they even gave them an answer. They had no doubt of speedily arriving
    at a peace; meantime the petitioners were enjoined to return to their
    own homes. By this time their numbers were swollen to five thousand and
    more, among them being men dressed as women. They flocked round the
    door of the House of Commons, crying “Peace! Peace!” and presently,
    “Give us those Traitors that are against Peace, that we may tear them
    to pieces! Give us that dog Pym!” The trained bands were sent for, but
    were received by these Amazons with brick-bats, whereupon the soldiers
    fired upon the women, killed some, and dispersed the rest.
  </p>

  <p>
    The violence and insolence of the mob during this unhappy time shows
    the want of executive strength in the City. Measures are passed; no one
    heeds them; a riot is suppressed and it breaks out again; disbanded
    soldiers swarm in the streets and rob and plunder as they please.
    We have seen how the mob murdered Dr. Lamb. On another occasion the
    mob had forced its way into the Court of High Commission. They had
    assembled at Westminster, crying “No Bishops!” They had been driven
    down King Street by officers with drawn swords. After the war broke
    out the mob was divided between the two factions, each having its own
    badge. When the war brought the usual troubles, with want of money and
    of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
    trade, both sides joined and riotously clamoured for peace. As
    early as 1643, with six years of war before it, the mob besieged the
    House of Commons, clamouring for peace. The most remarkable effort of
    the mob was that of the “Solemn Engagement” in 1647 related by Sharpe:—
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “A week later (21 July) a mob of apprentices, reformadoes,
      watermen and other disaffected persons met at Skinner’s Hall, and
      one and all signed a solemn Engagement pledging themselves to
      maintain the Covenant and to procure the king’s restoration to
      power on the terms offered by him on the 12th May last, viz. the
      abandonment of the episcopacy for three years and the militia for
      ten. An endeavour was made to enlist the support of the municipal
      authorities to this engagement, but a letter from Fairfax (23 July)
      soon gave them to understand that the army looked on the matter as
      one ‘set on foot by the malice of some desperate-minded men, this
      being their last engine for the putting all into confusion when
      they could not accomplish their wicked ends by other means.’ On the
      24th both Houses joined in denouncing the Solemn Engagement of the
      City, their declaration against it being ordered to be published by
      beat of drum and sound of trumpet through London and Westminster,
      and within the lines of communication. Any one found subscribing
      his name to the engagement after such publication would be adjudged
      guilty of high treason.”
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Another serious outbreak took place later, on Sunday, April 10, 1648.
    A multitude was assembled in Moorfields to drink and play. A company
    of trained bands endeavoured to suppress the profanation of the day,
    and were themselves set upon and dispersed. The mob, gathering greater
    strength, went off to Whitehall, where they were driven back by the
    troops. Returning to the City, they broke open houses and magazines,
    seized the gates and chains, attacked the Lord Mayor’s house, and
    called upon everybody to join them for God and King Charles. General
    Fairfax let them alone one night, and in the morning sent out troops,
    and after some resistance dispersed them.
  </p>

  <p>
    Every success or partial success made the Royalist party in the City
    more fearless and undisguised; sometimes they mounted cockades;
    sometimes they burned bonfires; sometimes they openly cried for the
    King; the ’prentices, who had been so ready to petition against the
    Bishops, turned round. Though the actual weight of numbers and of
    opinions was in favour of the Parliament, there was a very strong party
    who were always looking for an opportunity to demonstrate, if not to
    rise, for the King. One has only to consult the pages of Evelyn in
    order to understand the strength of the Royalist party even in times of
    the deepest adversity.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have already quoted from Howell. Let him speak again concerning the
    condition of the City at this time:—
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “Touching the condition of Things here, you shall understand that
      our Miseries lengthen with our Days; for tho’ the Sun and the
      Spring advance nearer us, yet our Times are not grown a whit the
      more comfortable. I am afraid this City has fooled herself into
      a Slavery; the Army, tho’ forbidden to come within ten Miles of
      her by order of Parliament, quarters now in the Bowels of her;
      they threaten to break her Percullies, Posts, and Chains, to
      make her previous upon all occasions; they have secured also the
      Tower, with Addition of Strength for themselves; besides a famine
      doth insensibly creep upon us, and the Mint is starved for want
      of Bullion; Trade, which was ever the Sinew of this Island, doth
      visibly decay, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
      and the insurance of ships is risen from two to ten
      in the hundred; our Gold is engrossed in private hands, or gone
      beyond Sea to travel without License; and much I believe of it is
      returned to the Earth (whence it first came) to be buried where our
      descendants may chance to find it a thousand years hence, if the
      world lasts so long; so that the exchanging of white earth into red
      (I mean Silver into Gold) is now above six in the hundred; and all
      these, with many more, are the dismal effects and concomitants of a
      Civil War. ’Tis true, we have had many such black days in England
      in former Ages; but those paralleled to the present are as a Shadow
      of a Mountain compared to the Eclipse of the Moon.”
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    The weaker side always takes refuge in epigrams. I have before me a
    little book called <cite>Two Centuries of Paul’s Churchyard</cite>, which contains
    (1) a list of imaginary books, (2) questions for tender consciences.
    The following extracts will show the temper of the Royalists in London
    during the Civil War:—
  </p>

  <blockquote>

    <p>
      “Ecclesiasticus. A plain demonstration that Col. Pride (alias

    In “A True Relation of two Merchants of London who were taken prisoners
    by the Cavaliers and of the Misery they and the other Puritans
    endured”—a pamphlet of 1642—I think we have one of those documents,
    of which Napoleon so well understood the use, which were meant to
    stimulate enmity and provoke wrath. It is an interesting paper, but
    one remarks that the only cruelty endured by the two merchants was due
    to a smoky chimney; that they report various hangings, but they were
    not themselves hanged; and various slashings of ears, but they brought
    their own away with them; and, as is common in such documents, they
    report the evil case of the enemy and their resolution to destroy the
    City of London when they get in.
  </p>

  <p>I take an extract from it as follows:—</p>

  <p>
    “Warre hath seemed alwayes sweet to those who have been unexperienced
    with it, who, blinded with its flourish and its glory, observe not
    the tragicall events that doe attend it. Of all war the civill is
    most grievous, where all the obligations of friendship and nature lye
    cancelled in one another’s blood, and violated by their hands who
    should bee most carefull to preserve them. In civill warres there hath
    been no greater stickler than religion, whose innocent and sacred
    garment hath been too often traduced to palliate all dissolute and
    bloody acts, and (as if heaven suffered flatterers as well as Princes)
    religion and loyalty have been induced to beleeve they are protected
    most by those men who most dangerously and most closely doe oppose
    them, and who, while both are trampled on them by them, doe still cry
    out, For God and the King.
  </p>

  <p>
    Every day brings in many sad demonstrations concerning this subject;
    the burning of houses, the pillaging of goods, the violating of all
    lawes, both divine and humane, have been arguments written in blood
    by too many swords. What I shall now relate concerning the sufferings
    of these two Gentlemen, who were taken by the Cavaliers, and what
    outrages they have performed in the time of their durance, will bee a
    compendious mixture of all distresses in one story, wherein I shall
    bee<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
    carefull to satisfie the reader with the manner of it, as myselfe
    with the truth, not doubting but it will find as much beliefe in the
    reader as it hath done compassion in the writer.
  </p>

  <p>
    Two Citizens of London, Gentlemen of good repute and quality (who
    will be ready upon their oaths to give an attestation of what is here
    reported), travelling not many days towards Hartly Row, concerning
    some private occasions of their owne, were taken in their way at
    Hounsloe, at the sign of the Katharine Wheele, by a party of some fifty
    Cavaliers, who had then been forraging up and downe the County of
    Middlesex, to see what good booty and pillage they could bring.
  </p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    These Gentlemen no sooner alighted, with an intent for an houre or two
    to refresh themselves, and bait their horses, but the Cavaliers had
    notice of it, who rudely and violently did breake into the Chamber
    wherein they were, and tooke them prisoners. From their Chambers
    they made haste downe into the Stable, and seized upon their horses,
    and inforced these captive Gentlemen to ride behinde two of them
    unto Eggham, to be examined there by Prince Robert. They found their
    journey, though short, extreamly troublesome, beeing never used to
    ride before without a saddle; and having such desperate companions on
    either Saddle before them to conduct them. Comming to Eggham they found
    Prince Robert in bed, his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
    clothes being on; for he had made a vow that
    he would never undresse nor shifte himselfe till he had resetted King
    Charles in White Hall. In the examination it was laid to the charrge
    of one of these Gentlemen, that his wife was a Roundhead, and if they
    had her there present, they did sweare they would hang her. It was
    alledged against the other Gentleman, that hee was a Preacher in a Tub,
    which, being with much scornfull sport and vehemency prosecuted, at
    length they espied (having seldome seen in a preacher) a great branch
    of Ribbands in his hat; the Prince took the paines to look them over
    himselfe, and turned and tossed them up and downe, and not finding what
    he searched for, he swore there was none of the King’s favours there.
    The Gentleman replying that they were his Mistress’s, Prince Robert
    smiling, without giving any word at all, returned him his favours and
    his hat againe.
  </p>

  <p>
    From thence they were committed to the Court of guard, and a Captain
    had a charge over them, who was a Frenchman; he placed them both
    together by the fireside, where the winde did drive all the smoke
    into their eyes. Though they were almost blinded and choaked with the
    smoake, which still in waving tumults did issue from the Chimney upon
    them, they durst not stirre, though to discharge the most earnest
    Offices of Nature, but had a guard set over them, who threatened and
    swore, God darne them, they would pistoll them.
  </p>

  <p>
    That night Prince Robert was to march from Hounsloe, and either wanting
    guides in earnest, or their cruelty making mirth with these honest
    Gentlemen, they made their conducts, and following them with their
    pistols, they did sweare, that if they led them but a yard out of the
    way they immediately would shoot them.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was a lamentable condition that these two Gentlemen were in; they
    were not well acquainted with the way, the smoke had almost blinded
    their eyes, the night was as darke as cold, which were both then in
    extreames, they saw their lives at the mercy of these mercilesse men;
    and to make their condition yet worse, there did arise a thick and
    sudden mist, which tooke from them the little knowledge of the way they
    had before; they were not suffered to eate or drinke one drop, though
    they offered to pay freely for it, and were ready to starve for cold
    and hunger, but were still pursued with reproachfull and contumelious
    words, as, Lead on, lead on, you Parliament dogges; if you lead us but
    one yard out of the way, we will hang you, wee will pistoll you both.
    The Army being come to the Rendezvous, they were driven before it with
    many other prisoners, being coupled in cords two by two.
  </p>

  <p>
    That day the Army being to march towards London, with a resolution to
    take the Citie, they were left in bonds at the Rendezvous.
  </p>

  <p>
    The King and Prince were then on Hounsloe Heath, and were marching
    towards Brainford;<a id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> they made full account (whatsoever is suggested
    to the contrary) to have surprized the Citie of London. Prince Robert
    put off his scarlet coat, which <span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
    was very riche, and gave it to his
    man, and buckled on his armour, and put a gray coat over it, that he
    might not bee discovered; he talked long with the King, and often in
    his communication with his Majesty he scratched his head, and tore his
    haire, as if hee had been in some great discontent.
  </p>

  <p>
    There was that day apprehended a Gentleman cloathed in Scarlet, and
    hanged in a with upon a tree, as it is conceived for speaking in honour
    of the Parliament, and no man suffered to cut him downe or cover his
    face, untill he had been made a publicke spectacle to the whole Army
    which was then marching by. This was done in the way betwixt Eggham and
    Staines.
  </p>

  <p>
    Dr. Soame, vicar of Staines, having four or five daughters, in great
    jollity did ride up and downe the Army, and was very familiar with
    the Commanders, and it was thought some of those Commanders were as
    familiar with his daughters; for they did ride behinde some Captaines,
    who took them up on horsebacke, and being more mindfull of them than of
    their souldiers, shewed them the whole Army, as they marched by.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Army being prevented, and their hopes frustrated for the surprizing
    of the Citie of London, they were driven back to their Rendezvous,
    where these two honest Gentlemen, after many solicitations for their
    release, procured at length some men to passe their words for their
    ransome; and after eight dayes imprisonment, finding a convenient
    opportunity for their escape, they stole away to Brainford, making so
    much haste, that when they came thither they had not one dry threed
    about them. The misery these two Gentlemen indured hath beene almost
    inexpressible; they were cudgelled by the Cavaliers, and drove with the
    other prisoners, like beasts before the Army; their eyes were tormented
    to see the slaughter and execution of their friends, their eares furred
    to heare the blasphemies of their enemies, their bellies were pinched
    with hunger, their whole bodies with cold, their understandings with
    the apprehension of some infamous death; for not an houre hardly
    passed away, wherein they were not threatened to be hanged. Whatsoever
    calamity the insolency of men could inflict, they indured, and doe
    believe the bondage under the Turk to be humanity and mercy compared
    to their slavery, who being now in the armes of safety, have drawne my
    sad pen from the relation of their sorrowes to touch a little on the
    tyranny of the Cavaliers, and on the extremities of those men who were
    fellow captives with them.
  </p>

  <p>
    The poore people that were not able to pay ransomes, they did put into
    a pond stark naked, up to the knees in durt, in a cold night, and
    drove them the next morning before the Camp, the basest of the Army
    inveighing against them with most opprobrious language, calling them
    Round-headed Citizens, Parliament Rogues, and Parliament Dogges.
  </p>

  <p>
    They took one in Thistleworth, an honest and religious man, who,
    because he said he was for the King and Parliament, they most
    inhumanely did cut off his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
    eares and gave him besides 30 wounds in his
    body, and not content with this butchery, they threw him afterwards on
    the Dunghill with this most unchristian scoffe, ‘Let the dogs lick him.’
  </p>

  <p>
    They took another in the same towne, who, flying from their fury, got
    into a house, and, having barred fast the gate, not long after he
    was inforced to open it to let in his wife, when the Cavaliers came
    violently rushing in after her, and, fastning a cord unto his feet,
    they dragged him about the streets; and weary of their cruelty, they
    said, ‘Why do we trouble ourselves any longer with this Dogge,’ and so
    discharging their pistols on him, they discharged him of his torments,
    and his life together.
  </p>

  <p>
    They are very poore in cloathes, especially the foot, but are very full
    of money; wheresoever they come, they pay for nothing, yet make pillage
    of whatsoever they come at; and what they get in one towne at very
    easie rates, they doe sell in another, and doe inforce the inhabitants
    to buy their commodities and stolne goods of them, whether they will
    or no. There was a Captaine who offered to lend three hundred pound
    to any man upon good security, and that being lent forth, hee made no
    question, he said, but in a few days to be able to lend as much more.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Cavaliers and all are driven unto such necessity, as they are
    constrained sometimes either to fast or to feed on carrion; they have
    killed Ewes great with lambe, and one Ewe that was great with two
    lambes. Whatsoever they cannot eat at any time, bee their diet never
    so good, they throw away; and whatsoever is left of their hay and
    provender (their horses many times feeding on good wheat, which they
    take from the owner), they fling away at their departure, alledging
    they will leave nothing behind them for the Parliament Roundheads.
  </p>

  <p>
    They drinke and sweare extreamly, and although they lately were
    prevented in their designe upon the Citie of London, wherein they
    verily expected a great and strong party to assist them, they say, that
    ere it be long, they will returne to it againe, and are so confident
    either by stratagem or by strength to win it, that when anything comes
    crosse them, they will say, ‘No matter, ere it be long, London shall
    make amends for all.’”

  <p class="noindent">
    <span class="smcap">After</span> the execution of the King, the Commons, by an Act, abolished
    Monarchy and erected a Commonwealth in its place. Orders were sent to
    the Mayor and Sheriffs requiring them to make proclamation accordingly.
    The Mayor, however, Reynardson, who had always shown Royalist leanings,
    refused to obey on the ground that he had already, in entering upon
    the various offices which he had held, taken so many oaths of loyalty
    that he could not, in conscience, obey. He was therefore committed to
    the Tower for two months, deprived of his Mayoralty, and fined £2000
    for contempt. And the City was ordered to elect a new Mayor with all
    convenient speed.
  </p>

  <p>
    The City obeyed; Alderman Atkins was chosen Mayor, and on the 30th
    of May the proclamation was duly made, but not without hooting and
    groaning from the crowd. Two Aldermen, Soames and Chambers, were not
    present. On being questioned at the Bar of the House, Soames said
    boldly that the proclamation was against his judgment and conscience;
    Chambers that his heart was not in the business. They were therefore
    degraded from their position and declared incapable of filling any City
    office for the future.
  </p>

  <p>
    A day of public thanksgiving was then appointed, when the City invited
    the House of Commons to hear a sermon at Christ Church, Newgate, and
    afterwards to a noble entertainment at the Grocers’ Hall. The day
    after, the City presented Fairfax with a basin and ewer of gold, and
    Cromwell with a hundred pounds’ worth of plate and a purse of £200 in
    gold.
  </p>

  <p>
    The exchange of presents and courtesies ended, for the time, with the
    presentation to the City, by the House of Commons, of Richmond Park.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the 19th of September 1650 another day of thanksgiving was held for
    the victory of Dunbar, and another after the victory of Worcester.
  </p>

  <p>
    Cromwell was received on his return to London by the Mayor, Aldermen,
    and Sheriffs, who invited him to a Banquet.

  <p>
    On the forcible dissolution of the old Parliament, petitions were
    presented to Cromwell by the City for and against the reinstatement of
    the Parliament. Cromwell met them both by constituting a certain number
    of persons the “Supreme
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
    Authority.” The City, recognising this body, presented a petition in which they prayed:—
  </p>

  <p>
    “1. That the precious Truths of the Gospel may be preserved in Purity;
    and the Dispensers thereof, being approved to be learned, godly, and
    void of Offence, may be sent forth to preach the Gospel. 2. That
    their settled Maintenance by Law might be confirmed, and their just
    Properties preserved. 3. That the Universities may be zealously
    countenanced and encouraged.” (<cite>Maitland</cite>, vol. i. p. 421.)

  <p>
    The “Supreme Authority” surrendering its power, Cromwell was made
    Protector, a step which the City hastened to recognise by inviting him
    to dine at the Guildhall, and receiving him with all the honours of a
    sovereign.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the discovery of a conspiracy against his person, Cromwell sent for
    the Mayor and Aldermen, and, after acquainting them with the nature of
    the plot, recommended to them the safety and peace of the City, giving
    them at the same time, in order to strengthen their hands, the entire
    control of the City Militia. He also sanctioned the revival of the
    Honourable Artillery Company.
  </p>

  <p>
    As regards affairs municipal, Cromwell limited the number of
    hackney coachmen to two hundred, under the license of the Mayor and
    Corporation; and for the sake of the poor he allowed the entrance into
    the port, free of duty, of 4000 chaldrons of coals every year.
  </p>

  <p>
    Cromwell also renewed the attempts of Elizabeth, James, and Charles to
    stop the erection of new buildings; all those persons who had built
    houses—except on four acres of ground—since 1620 were fined one year’s
    rent, and all those who should build after 1656 were to be fined £100.
    These successive Acts caused great vexation at the time, but as they
    were never enforced save at irregular intervals, the chief effect was
    to drive across the river into the Borough those of the craftsmen for
    whom there was no room in the City.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Common Council proceeded to consider the allowances for the
    expenses of the Mayor and the Sheriffs; these were now fixed at £208:6s.
    a month for the former, and £150 a month for each of the latter.
  </p>

  <p>
    A Committee was appointed “to manage and to let to farm a number of
    offices, including those of garbling, package, and scavage, metage of
    grain, coal, salt and fruit, as well as all fines, issues, amerciaments
    and estreated recognizances under the greenwax.”
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span></p>

  <p>
    The condition of the poor was taken in hand at this time very
    seriously. A project was started to raise money by establishing a post
    in Scotland and other parts of the country; but the House of Commons
    resolved that the office of postmaster in every part of the country
    is in the power and the disposal of the Parliament; the project,
    therefore, fell through; meantime the poor remained. It was decided to
    raise £4600 in order to find work for them; a storehouse was set apart
    for them in the Minories and the King’s Wardrobe, part of the Palace
    so-called, one court of which remained until recently—to be used as a
    workroom.

  <p>
    The weariness of civil war felt by the Londoners was further displayed
    in the autumn of 1650 when a contingent of recruits was marched from
    London to the North to join the army in Scotland. Half of them deserted
    by the way. In the following year the City remonstrated on the heavy
    taxation from which they suffered, stating that the City was assessed
    at a fifteenth part of the whole kingdom; that the foreign trade had
    suffered grievously from Prince Rupert’s piracies; that the wealthier
    citizens were withdrawing from London to the suburbs, and so evading
    taxation. The last clause is remarkable. The time had not yet come when
    the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
    wealthier merchants desired to leave the City and to live outside;
    the practice shows simply that in this way they avoided taxation.
  </p>

  <p>
    The battle of Worcester, September 3, 1651, put an end to the Civil
    War. A few days later the unhappy Scottish prisoners were marched
    through the City, ragged, barefoot, bareheaded, starving—a terrible
    spectacle. Meal was collected for them from house to house; they were
    taken to Tothill Fields in Westminster, where they lay in the open
    under rain and suffering from the cold winds of autumn. Twelve hundred
    of them died. The rest were sent away to the Gold Coast, whence none
    ever came back.
  </p>

  <p>
    War with Holland broke out in 1652 and a subscription of £1071:9:5
    for the wounded sailors and soldiers was raised in the City.
  </p>

  <p>
    On December 16, 1653, the Lord Mayor carried the City Sword at the
    installation of Cromwell as Lord Protector. Two months later he dined
    with the Mayor and Corporation at Grocers’ Hall. This interchange of
    courtesies continued during the rest of Cromwell’s rule.
  </p>

  <p>
    The connection of the City with the Protector offers very little
    of importance. When the proclamation was made, six weeks after the
    execution of the King, abolishing monarchy, the City made no protest
    either by its Common Council or by any popular movement. When a
    Commonwealth was proclaimed in May there were many refusals among
    the clergy and others to promise fidelity to the new order, but no
    remonstrance came from the City. When Cromwell dissolved the Rump “not
    a dog barked” either in the City or outside.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Fifth Monarchy men, a small minority, gave some trouble in the
    City. They were fanatics of the deepest dye. They would have no King
    but Jesus Christ, and no Parliament but a Sanhedrin of Saints—meaning
    themselves.
  </p>

  <p>
    Among all the sects which drove men mad perhaps the most mischievous
    was that of the “Fifth Monarchy” men. It was a sect whose adherents
    were principally found in London. At one time they were numerous enough
    to be important. They supported Cromwell’s Government at first in the
    faith that it would become the “Fifth Monarchy,” in succession, that
    is, to the Assyrian, the Persian, the Grecian, and the Roman. During
    the Fifth Monarchy, they thought, Christ would reign, with the saints,
    for a thousand years. Their leader was one Venner, a wine cooper, but
    among them were certain officers, as Major-General Harrison, Colonel
    Rich, and others. When the proposal that Cromwell should assume the
    title of King was first brought forward, the Fifth Monarchy men, being
    disappointed in their hopes and acknowledging no King but Christ,
    prepared for a rising; they were to meet at Mile End Green, where they
    expected to be joined by thousands from the country as well as from
    the City. They were arrested with arms in their hands and sent to
    the Tower, but none were executed. The man Venner gave more trouble
    afterwards. There were, however, signs of Royalist disaffection,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
    rumours of proposed risings and the suppression of actual risings, both
    before and after Cromwell’s death, in which the apprentices of London
    were more or less implicated.
  </p>

  <p>
    What followed Cromwell’s death belongs to the general history of the
    country. Lambert treated the Parliament with the greatest insolence
    and arrogance. Monk marched south, pretending to vindicate the rights
    of Parliament; the apprentices rose and rushed about the streets
    clamouring for a free Parliament; Colonel Heron with a company of
    soldiers fired upon them. The Aldermen exchanged explanations on the
    subject with the Committee of Safety. The Common Council petitioned
    Fleetwood for a Parliament as in 1642; the petition was returned. The
    City Remembrancer was sent to expostulate with Fleetwood, who finally
    promised a free Parliament. It is difficult to understand what else
    he could do; there was no second Cromwell; the City called out six
    regiments of its own militia, commanded by its officers nominated by
    the Common Council.

  <p>
    If we inquire why a city which before the death of the King seemed
    Republican and Presbyterian through and through, should in ten years
    become in the same thorough manner Royalist and Episcopal; or, to put
    it more exactly, why the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
    Republican majority became so unmistakably a
    Royalist majority, we shall find that many forces were at work in this
    direction.
  </p>

  <p>
    First of all, though the governing body was both Republican and
    Presbyterian, there were numbers of citizens who had preserved their
    loyalty to the Crown, and many more who, for divers reasons, hated the
    Puritan rule. We have seen the petition of the women and that of the
    apprentices; we have seen the rioting and discontent at the prohibition
    of the old sports and the closing of the play-houses. There were also
    other causes; the Londoners were ready to go forth and fight a battle,
    but not to carry on a long war; further, they distrusted the standing
    army which had taken the place of the trained bands. Again, trade was
    depressed; many ships were taken by Prince Rupert off the Nore and in
    the narrow seas, and the whole City was kept in perpetual controversies
    and quarrels over points of doctrine. With a decaying trade, a city
    divided against itself, religious quarrels without religious peace, the
    young folk longing for the restoration of the old sports, every tavern
    full of discontented men, every church a brawling place, what wonder
    if, after ten years and more, the City suddenly turned round and cried
    for the King and the Church to come back again.

  <p>
    Yet the events which followed Cromwell’s death and preceded the
    Restoration were very closely connected with the City of London. The
    domination of the City
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
    by the army deeply moved the people. The
    clamour for a Parliament prevailed; on the 29th of December 1659 the
    old Rump was recalled. It was not a full and a free Parliament. But
    such as it was, the House viewed with jealousy the repair of the City
    gates and the restoration of the chains, with the calling out of the
    City militia. The City, however, which had but one representative in
    the House, refused absolutely to pay or to levy any tax until there
    was full representation. Meantime Monk was advancing from the north.
    He entered London on the 3rd of February 1660, and was quartered at
    Whitehall. For the moment he either dissembled his real intentions or
    he was simply waiting.

    <div class="link"><a href="#trans_071">Go to transcription of text</a></div>
  </div>

  <p>
    The Rump hastened its own fall. In consequence of the attitude of the
    Common Council it declared that body dissolved; it also ordered the
    gates and chains of the City to be removed, and troops to be quartered
    there in order to reduce the City to obedience.
  </p>

  <p>
    Monk, in order to carry out these instructions, removed into the City,
    where he conferred with the Aldermen. They would do nothing; the Common
    Council being dissolved, there was no body which had the power of
    speaking for the City.
  </p>

  <p>
    Monk met them again on the following day. He read them a letter which
    he had sent to the House. He demanded that writs for every seat should
    be ready for issue within a week.
  </p>

  <p>
    Great was the joy of the City; bonfires were lighted; bells were set
    ringing, and the soldiers were feasted by the people.
  </p>

  <p>The next day, being Sunday, Monk attended service at St. Paul’s.</p>

  <p>
    On the 13th, Monday, he conferred with the Mayor and Aldermen in
    Drapers’ Hall.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the 15th he informed the Mayor that he was about to return to
    Whitehall, but that he should take care of the safety of the City.
    However, he did not go back; he remained in the City.
  </p>

  <p>
    Meantime his order about the writs had been obeyed; many of the old
    members were taking their places, including those ejected for various
    reasons. The order dissolving the Common Council was rescinded and
    the gates were allowed to be repaired. It does not appear that much
    damage had been done to them. The House also allowed the City to place
    its militia in the hands of Commissioners of its own choice. On March
    16 the Parliament—the old Long Parliament which had done so much,
    suffered so much, and gone through so many vicissitudes—dissolved.
    Writs were issued for a new Parliament to meet on April 25. Meantime
    the Government was in the hands of the Council of State.
  </p>

  <p>
    And now people began to talk openly and freely of the Restoration. One
    man boldly set a ladder against the wall of the Royal Exchange and
    brushed out the inscription, “Exit Tyrannus Regum Ultimus,” which had
    been set up in August 1650. The Skinners’ Company set up the Royal
    Arms once more in their Hall.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
    The Common Council issued a Declaration
    in which they set forth their disavowal of many acts committed by
    themselves during the last twenty years on the ground that they were
    the work of “men of loose and dangerous” principles who had got into
    the Council “in the general deluge of disorder introduced into these
    kingdoms.” They also expressed satisfaction at the thought of an end
    having been put to the destructions of the country and of a return to
    the old order of King, Lords, and Commons.
  </p>

  <p>
    This Declaration was scarcely issued before a letter came from Charles
    II. conveying his assurance that he had no thoughts of revenge, and
    promising the City the confirmation of its Charters. He also pledged
    himself to grant liberty of conscience in religion, to leave questions
    of title to land to Parliament, and he promised the soldiers their
    arrears of pay.
  </p>

  <p>
    The new Parliament met on the 25th of April. Charles’s Declaration
    reached the House on the 1st of May. Parliament instantly sent to the
    City to borrow £100,000, which was cheerfully advanced, and half of it
    was at once sent over to the King. On the same day the City companies
    raised the sum of £10,000 for Charles, and £2000 to be divided between
    the Dukes of York and Gloucester. Sixteen commissioners were appointed
    to wait on Charles at the Hague in order to take over this Royal gift.
  </p>

  <p>Charles was proclaimed on May the 18th.</p>

    upon their knees; they broke the windows of leading Puritans; they made
    Monk’s soldiers drunk. It was not only the King who had come to his
    own again; it was the return of merriment, feasting, dancing, singing,
    mumming, sports, music, laughing, the pride of the eye, the delight
    of the ear, the joy of the world, the careless, reckless, headlong
    happiness of youth in the things that belong to youth. The kingdom of

    the time was ripe for the advent of that kingdom.

  <p>
    But let us begin this reign with the words of those who looked on at
    the Restoration:—
  </p>

  <p>
    “Mem. that Threadneedle Street was all day long and late at night
    crammed with multitudes crying out, ‘A free Parliament!—A free
    Parliament!’ that the air rang again with their noise. One day, he,
    coming out on horseback, they were so violent that he was almost afraid
    of himself, and so, to satisfy them (as they used to do to importunate
    children), said, ‘Pray be quiet, ye shall have a Free Parliament!’ This
    was about seven, or rather eight, as I remember, at night; immediately
    a loud halloa and shout was given, all the bells in the city ringing;
    and the whole city looked as if it had been in a flame by the bonfires,
    which were prodigiously great and frequent, and ran like a train over
    the city; and I saw some balconies that began to be kindled. They made
    little gibbets, and roasted rumps of mutton; nay, I saw some very good
    rumps of beef. Health to K. Charles II. was drunk in the streets, by
    the bonfires, even on their knees.”
  </p>

  <p>And Pepys writes:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “In Cheapside there were a great many bonfires, and Bow bells
      and all the bells in all the churches as we went home, were
      ringing.” [Hence he went homeward, it being about ten at night.]
      “But the common joy that was everywhere to be seen; the number of
      bonfires!—there being fourteen between St. Dunstan’s and Temple
      Bar; and at Strand Bridge I could at one time tell thirty-one
      fires; in King Street seven or eight; and all along burning, and
      roasting, and drinking for rumps; there being rumps tied upon
      sticks, and carried up and down. The butchers at the May-Pole in
      the Strand rang a peal with their knives, when they were going
      to sacrifice their rump. On Ludgate Hill there was one turning
      the spit that had a rump tied upon it, and another basting of
      it. Indeed, it was past imagination both the greatness and the
      suddenness of it. At one end of the street you would think there
      was a whole lane of fire and smoke, so hot that we were fain to
      keep on the other side.... Everybody now drinks the King’s health
      without any fear, whereas before it was very private that a man
      dare do it. Monk this day is feasted at Mercers’ Hall, and is
      invited, one after another, to all the twelve Halls in London. Many
      think that he is honest yet, and some or more think him to be a
      fool that would raise himself by endeavouring it.... This morning
      comes Mr. Edward Pickering; he tells me that the King will come in,
      but that Monk did resolve to have the doing of it himself or else
      to hinder it.”
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    When Parliament met all the members must have understood what was
    going to happen. On the 3rd of May, Sir John Greville presented to
    the House a letter from Charles. It was resolved that his promises
    were satisfactory and that the Government should be once more by King,
    Lords, and Commons. Six Commissioners representing the House of Lords,
    twelve for the House of Commons, and twenty for the City of London,
    were appointed; they were instructed to take over £50,000 for the King,
    £10,000 for the Duke of York, and £5000 for the Duke of Gloucester; the
    City Commissioners added a gift of £10,000 for the King.
  </p>

  <p>
    “There was great joy in London,” Pepys states, “and at night more
    bonfires than ever, and ringing of bells, and drinking of the King’s
    health upon their knees in the streets, which methinks is a little too
    much.”
  </p>

  <p>
    On the 26th of May 1660 the King landed at Dover; on the 29th he
    entered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
    London. The cavalcade which did honour to the occasion was
    worthy of a mediæval riding.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “First marched a gallant troop of gentlemen in Cloth of Silver,
      brandishing their Swords, and led by Major-General Brown; then
      followed another troop of two hundred in velvet coats with footmen
      and liveries attending them in purple; then another troop, led by
      Alderman Robinson, in buff coats, with cloth of silver sleeves,
      and very rich green scarves; and after these a troop of about two
      hundred, with blue liveries laid with silver, with six trumpeters,
      and several footmen, in sea-green and silver; then a troop of
      two hundred and twenty, with thirty footmen in grey and silver
      liveries and four trumpeters richly habited. Then another troop
      of an hundred and five, with grey liveries and six trumpets; and
      another of seventy, with five trumpets. And then three troops
      more, two of three hundred, and one of one hundred, all gloriously
      habited and gallantly mounted. After these came two trumpets with
      his Majesty’s arms; the Sheriffs’ men in red cloaks, richly laced
      with silver to the number of fourscore, with half-pikes in their
      hands; then followed six hundred of the several companies of London
      on horseback, in black velvet coats with gold chains, each company
      having footmen in different liveries, with streamers, etc. After
      these came kettle-drums, and trumpets, with streamers, and after
      them twelve Ministers at the head of His Majesty’s Life Guards of
      Horse, commanded by the Lord Gerrard; next the City Marshall, with
      eight footmen in divers colours; with the City Waits and Officers
      in order; then the two Sheriffs, and all the Aldermen of London in
      their scarlet coats and rich trappings, with footmen in liveries,
      red coats laid with silver and cloth of gold; the Heralds and
      Maces in rich coats; then the Lord Mayor carrying the Sword, bare,
      with his Excellency (the General) and the Duke of Buckingham, bare
      also; and then, as the last to all this splendid triumph, rode the
      King himself between his royal brothers, the Dukes of York and
      Gloucester; then followed a troop of Horse with white colours; and
      after them the General’s Life-Guard led by Sir Philip Howard, and
      another Troop of Gentry; and last of all five regiments of the Army
      Horse, with Back, Breast, and Head-Pieces, which diversified the
      Shew with delight and terror.”
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    At the Coronation in April of the following year, the City, still in
    a fever of loyalty, raised four triumphal arches, and organised a
    procession as magnificent as that of the entry. After the Coronation
    was the Banquet, at which Pepys was so fortunate as to be a spectator:—
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “A little while before the King had done all his ceremonies (in
      the Abbey) I went round to Westminster Hall all the way within
      rayles, with the ground covered with blue cloth, and scaffolds all
      the way. Into the Hall I got, where it was very fine with hangings
      and scaffolds one upon another, full of brave ladies. The King
      came in with his crowne on and his sceptre in his hand, under a
      canopy borne up by six silver staves carried by barons of the
      Cinque Ports, and little bells at every end. And after a long time
      he got to the farther end, and all set themselves down at their
      several tables.... I went from table to table to see the bishops
      and all others at their dinner. And at the lords’ table I met with
      William Howe, and he spoke to my lord for me, and he did give him
      four rabbits and a pullet, and so Mr. Creed and I got Mr. Minshell
      to give us some bread, and so we at a stall eat it as every one
      else did what they could get. I took a great deal of pleasure to
      go up and down and look upon the ladies, and to hear the musique
      of all sorts; but, above all, the twenty-four violins. About six
      at night they had dined. And strange it is to think that these two
      days have held up fair till now, that all is done, and the King
      gone out of the Hall, and then it fell a-raining and thundering and
      lightning as I have not seen it do for some years, which people
      did take great notice of. I observed little disorder, only the
      King’s footmen had got hold of the canopy and would keep it from
      the barons of the Cinque Ports, which they endeavoured to force
      from them again, but could not do it till my lord Duke of Albemarle
      caused it to be put into Sir R. Pye’s hand, till to-morrow, to be
      decided.”

  <p>
    Between the King’s accession in May and the end of the year these
    fanatics seem to have done nothing. Many of their leaders, including
    Colonel Overton, Major Wild, Cornet Day, and others, were arrested
    on suspicion of dangerous symptoms. The Fifth Monarchy people had
    a meeting-house in Swan Alley, Coleman Street. Here on the sixth
    day of January 1661, the Sunday after the arrest of their leaders,
    they assembled in a state of mind approaching frenzy. What followed
    was madness pure and simple. Their preacher, Thomas Venner, the
    wine cooper, had acquired a competent fortune by his trade. He was
    believed to be a man of sense until his understanding was confused
    with enthusiasm. He, in common with his sect, looked on Charles as a
    usurper upon Christ’s dominion. On this particular Sunday his madness
    and the madness of his followers broke out. He assured them that the
    time of the Fifth Monarchy had arrived; that those who believed in it
    and expected it should be protected by Divine interference so that no
    weapon should hurt them, and not a hair should be touched among them
    all;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
    but one should chase a thousand and that two should put ten
    thousand to flight; that the Reign of Jesus was beginning that day upon
    the earth. Filled with enthusiasm the people drew up a declaration
    called “A door of Hope opened,” in which they affirmed they would
    never sheath the sword till Babylon (meaning the Monarchy) became a
    hissing and a curse; till there would be left neither remnant, son, nor
    nephew; that when they had led captivity captive in England, they would
    go forth into France, Spain, and Germany; that they would rather die
    than take the oaths of supremacy and allegiance; that they would make
    no league with monarchists, but would rise up against the carnal, to
    possess the gate of the world; to bind their kings in chains and their
    nobles in fetters of iron.

  <p>
    When they had adopted this promising declaration they marched out in
    a body of sixty only, but well armed, down Cheapside to St. Paul’s
    Churchyard, shouting as they went for “King Jesus.” In St. Paul’s
    Churchyard they were accosted by a man who cried out for King Charles.
    Him they slew immediately. By this time the Mayor, Sir Richard Brown,
    heard of the tumult, and sent a company of the trained bands to
    suppress it. The number of the company thus sent out is not known, but
    they were not strong enough. Instead of suppressing the fanatics they
    were themselves totally routed and put to flight. The Fifth Monarchy
    men then marched through the City without opposition; they passed out
    at Bishopsgate; then, evidently not knowing what to do next, they
    crossed Moorfields, marched along Chiswell Street, and, turning south
    again, re-entered the City at Cripplegate. It would have been better
    for them had they dispersed and gone home for the night, satisfied with
    their triumph and now convinced of their invulnerability. Unfortunately
    they heard of a troop of horse waiting for them somewhere, and so
    retreated, killing a headborough on the way, to Beech Lane. Here they
    encountered some opposition which caused them to march north as far as
    the heights of Hampstead. They found shelter, such as it was, for the
    night in Ken Woods, which are still left exactly as they were then. In
    the morning—they must have been wretched after a winter night in the
    open and with no food—they were attacked by more troops and dispersed,
    some of them being taken prisoners and committed to the Gatehouse,
    Westminster.
  </p>

  <p>
    Next day they rallied again and returned to London. This was the last
    day of the Rising. It was a day of sturdy and obstinate fighting. I
    do not know any other example where such a handful of men held out so
    long against such odds. Nor can one understand where the men got their
    ammunition. They fought on Sunday evening, Monday and Tuesday; they are
    described as firing in good order; where, then, did they procure their
    ammunition?
  </p>

  <p>
    When they arrived once more in London they divided into two small
    parties; one of them marched towards Leadenhall, where they were
    followed by the trained bands which dispersed them. The other party,
    under Venner, marched on
    Haberdashers’ Hall in Maiden Lane, hoping to
    catch the Mayor. But he evaded them. They then repaired to Wood Street,
    presumably intending to go out again by Cripplegate; the Horse Guards
    now came upon the scene, and a fierce fight ensued, in which Venner
    was dangerously wounded and two of their preachers killed. They then
    retreated in good order; outside the gate they stationed ten men in an
    alehouse with instructions to hold it; seven of the ten were killed, a
    large number of the trained bands, and twenty of the rebels. Fourteen
    were taken; eleven were executed with the customary formalities; and
    here they made an end; probably no further search was attempted after
    the rest of the rioters. It was wiser not to ascertain how many of
    these fanatics there were and who they were. We hear, however, very
    little more of the Fifth Monarchy men. As for the poor fanatics, they
    affirmed to the last that if they had been deceived, the Lord Himself
    was their deceiver.

      INCIDENTS IN THE REBELLION OF THE FIFTH MONARCHY MEN

  <p>
    On the 30th day of January 1661, the anniversary of King Charles’s
    execution, in the year following the Restoration, a remarkable
    procession took place through the streets of London to Tyburn. Horsemen
    led the way and brought up the rear; there were trumpets and drums;
    guards marched on either side; in the middle, one behind the other, on
    their sledges, sat Lord Munson, Sir Henry Mildmay, and Robert Wallop
    with ropes about their necks. The Act of Indemnity had spared their
    lives, but it had not spared them other penalties, and they went
    through the form of being drawn to execution. Arrived at Tyburn they
    were taken off the sledges and carried back to the Tower, there to pass
    the remainder of their days.
  </p>

  <p>
    Three more of the regicides, Okey, Corbet, and Berkstead, who had
    escaped to Hanau in Germany, were decoyed by Sir George Downey, the
    King’s resident at the Hague. He treacherously assured Okey that he
    had no directions to look for him; whereupon all three left Hanau and
    repaired to Delft, where they were arrested and sent home for trial.
    They were of course convicted and executed. No more honourable and
    conscientious man than Corbet ever existed. The death of these three
    was followed by that of Sir Harry Vane. Neither Vane nor Lambert was
    among the judges of the King. The House of Lords wished, however, to
    exclude both from the Act of Indemnity; the House of Commons desired to
    include them. The Chancellor assuring them that their lives were safe,
    both Houses agreed in a petition to the King:—
  </p>

  <p>
    “Your Majesty having declared your gracious pleasure to proceed only
    against the murderers of your royal Father, we, your Majesty’s most
    humble subjects, the Lords and Commons assembled, not finding Sir Henry
    Vane or Colonel Lambert to be of the number, are humble suitors to your
    Majesty that, if they shall be attainted, execution of their lives may
    be remitted.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Charles broke his word and Vane was executed, showing to the last the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
    firmness and courage which only a good conscience could give, this
    belongs to national history. He suffered on Tower Hill. His friends
    urged him after his sentence to make submission to the King. He
    replied:—
  </p>

  <p>
    “If his Majesty does not think himself more concerned for his honour
    and word than I am for my life, I am very willing he should take it;
    and I declare that I value my life less in a good cause than the King
    does his promise.” (<cite>Clayton</cite>, ii. p. 164.)
  </p>

  <p>
    Sir Harry Vane was a scholar of Oxford; he had travelled in France and
    stayed awhile in Geneva, where he had adopted the religious principles
    which ruled him through life. So much was he considered when quite
    young that the King entreated Laud to bring him to a more orthodox
    way of thinking. To avoid Laud’s frequent reproofs Vane went to
    America, where, at the age of four-and-twenty, he became Governor of
    Massachusetts Bay.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Act of Indemnity excluded the late King’s judges and certain
    persons who had been active in procuring the King’s execution. The
    trials of the State prisoners under the exceptions of this Act took
    place at the Old Bailey. On October 11 they were all sentenced to death
    as traitors, with the customary barbarities. Major-General Harrison,
    the Rev. Hugh Peters, Mr. Thomas Scot, Mr. Gregory Clement, and
    Colonels Scroop (or Scrope), John Jones, Francis Hacker, and Daniel
    Axtell were sentenced. Most of them were executed at Charing Cross.
  </p>

  <p>
    The case of Harrison was the most important. There is no doubt that
    he took an active part in bringing Charles to the block; yet he
    subsequently refused to assist Cromwell in his ambitions; he was
    imprisoned by Cromwell and deprived of his commission; on his release
    he retired to a private life, and refused to fly when the King
    returned. Brought before the Court, he made no attempt to deny the
    fact; on the contrary he gloried in it:—
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “The act of which I stand accused was not a deed performed in a
      corner; the sound of it has gone forth to most nations; and, in
      the singular and marvellous conduct of it, has chiefly appeared
      the sovereign power of Heaven.... I have often, agitated by
      doubts, offered my addresses, with passionate tears, to the Divine
      Majesty, and earnestly sought for light and conviction. I still
      received assurances of a heavenly sanction, and returned from such
      devout supplications with tranquillity and satisfaction. These
      frequent illapses of the Divine Spirit I could not suspect to be
      interested illusions: since I was conscious that for no temporal
      advantage would I have offered injury to the poorest individual.
      All the allurements of ambition, all the terrors of imprisonment
      have not been able, during the usurpation of Cromwell, to shake my
      steady resolution or bend me to a compliance with that deceitful
      tyrant: and, when invited by him to sit on the right hand of
      the throne—when offered riches, splendour, and dominion, I have
      disdainfully rejected all temptations, and, neglecting the tears of
      my friends and family, have still, through every danger, held fast
      my principles and my integrity.”
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    He then refused to say more and submitted to the sentence of the Court.
    The scene of the execution was Charing Cross; the day, October the
    14th, 1661. Evelyn met the carts carrying away the mangled quarters.
    “Oh!” he cried, “the miraculous providence of God!”

  <p class="noindent">
    <span class="smcap">There</span> is, perhaps, no time in the history of Great Britain of deeper
    interest and importance than that which witnessed the restoration
    and, later, the final expulsion of the Stuarts. We find the City at
    the outset weary of its Commonwealth, and longing for that security
    and order which are the best recommendations of a settled succession.
    And then the old business begins again. It seems as if the history of
    the last twenty years had been in vain, that the struggles and the
    victories had been forgotten.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have here to recount only the part played by London between the years
    1660 and 1688. Not, that is, the part played in London, otherwise we
    should have to consider nearly all the important events of the reign,
    which was passed almost entirely at Whitehall. In many cases it is
    difficult to decide between what belongs to London alone and what
    belongs to London and the country.
  </p>

  <p>
    The execution of Venner and his men did not clear the City of dangerous
    elements. The Fifth Monarchy people and the Presbyterians exhorted
    each other to withstand the introduction of the Book of Common Prayer
    and the idolatry of the Court. Some of them refused to obey the law
    unless the spirit ordered them. The City was full of disbanded officers
    and men who were ready and anxious to take up arms again. The King
    complained that the night watch was unable to cope with these turbulent
    people, and ordered that only able men should be appointed, and that
    their watch should continue all night.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Act of Uniformity of 1662 ordered every minister, if he would
    continue in his benefice, to assent to everything contained in the
    Book of Common Prayer. On Sunday, August 17, all the Presbyterians
    took leave of their congregations amid their tears and lamentations.
    Then persecution set in. It must be confessed that the language and
    action of some of the Nonconformists seemed to justify, in a certain
    measure, the rigours of the Government. For instance, the Baptists are
    said to have spoken openly of the King as the “Beast”; it was reported
    that Presbyterians and Baptists together were preparing to resist by
    force of arms; it must be remembered that these people represented the
    Roundheads of twenty years before.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
    The Act of Uniformity, rigorously
    enforced, filled the prisons, made the Church of England hateful to the
    people, and drove hundreds away to America and to Holland.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the same year an Act was passed for raising money for the paving of
    the streets of London by making every hackney coach—of which there were
    then four hundred—pay a tax of five pounds a year; every load of hay,
    sixpence; every load of straw, twopence. The Act provided especially
    for the paving of Hedge Lane (Whitcomb Street), from Petty France to
    St. James’s Palace, St. James’s Street, and Pall Mall. The paving was
    the old-fashioned round cobbles; before they were laid down the road
    was simply a trodden way, in the summer throwing up clouds of dust, in
    the winter knee-deep in mud. The Act further provided for the widening
    of certain ways and passages in the City. It is idle to ask if they
    were widened, because the Fire came a few years later and swept all
    away.
  </p>

  <p>
    The King in the same year formally restored to the City their Irish
    estates, which the Parliament had long before restored.
  </p>

  <p>On June 24, 1663, Charles granted the Inspeximus Charter.</p>

  <p>
    Accounts of the Plague of 1665 and the Fire of 1666 will be found in
    other places (pp. 215, 240).
  </p>

  <p>
    As soon as things were more settled after the Great Fire, the
    Corporation considered how best to avoid the recurrence of such a
    calamity. They divided the City into four divisions, each to be
    supplied with 800 buckets, 50 ladders, from 12 to 42 feet in length, 2
    brazen hand-squirts to each parish, 24 pickaxe sledges, and 40 “shod”
    shovels. Each of the twelve great companies was to be provided with an
    engine, 30 buckets, 3 ladders, 6 pickaxe sledges, and 2 hand-squirts.
    The inferior companies were to have such a number of engines, etc., as
    should be fixed by the Court of Aldermen. The Aldermen who had passed
    the Shrievalty were to keep 24 buckets and 1 hand-squirt each in his
    house. Those who had not yet passed the Shrievalty, half that number
    of buckets. Fire-plugs were to be placed in the main water-pipes. The
    companies of carpenters, bricklayers, plasterers, painters, masons,
    smiths, plumbers, and paviours were to appoint for each company 2
    master workmen, 4 journeymen, 8 apprentices, and 16 labourers, to be
    ready on an alarm to turn out. And lastly, all the workmen belonging
    to the several water-works, the sea coal meters, Blackwall Hall,
    Leadenhall, ticket, package, and other porters, were to attend the Lord
    Mayor and Sheriffs in such services. In other words, a fire brigade
    was established of several hundreds, with means of putting out fires
    amounting to about 1500 buckets and 300 hand-squirts. The weak point in
    this machinery was the difficulty of getting at the men when they were
    wanted, and the feeble nature of the hand-squirt.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Fire produced confusion in ecclesiastical property, for the tithes
    which had been levied from house to house could no longer be collected
    owing to the changes of site, the substitution of a small house for
    a great house, or <i xml:lang="la">vice versâ</i>. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
    therefore resolved that each
    parish should be assessed at so much per annum in lieu of tithe, and
    that each house should be assessed at its share of this amount. Trouble
    afterwards arose in the working of this Act in consequence of houses
    standing empty.
  </p>

  <p>
    The rebuilding of London was a great time for the passing of ordinances
    and regulations for the better preservation of order and cleanliness in
    the City. Thus the foot-passage, or way along the streets, was at this
    time ordered to be of flat or broad stone. The Fellowship of Carmen
    was ordered to send round carts for the collection of all waste stuff,
    which was to be conveyed to the nearest laystall.
  </p>

  <p>
    The traffic in the streets was regulated. Carts had to stand along, not
    across, the street; brewers and others were not to use more than one
    horse, nothing was to be thrown into the streets, every householder had
    to keep his own part of the street clean, and things offensive were not
    to be carried about the streets before eleven o’clock at night.
  </p>

  <p>
    The heavy losses caused first by the Plague, which stopped trade of
    all kinds and destroyed many thousands of craftsmen and servants,
    and next by the Fire, had reduced the City to a very low condition.
    No one will ever be able to estimate the losses of or consider the
    number of respectable families reduced to poverty, and plunged down
    into the lowest depths. A Committee, appointed by the Common Council
    to investigate the financial position of the City, had to recommend
    the abolition of certain offices and resolute retrenchment in many
    departments. Among other measures of economy the Committee recommended
    the abolition of their chronologer (see <a href="#Page_178">p. 178</a>).
  </p>

  <p>
    On June 10, 1667, the City, which was as yet only half-built, presented
    a most melancholy appearance. It had been devastated by plague, its
    people lay by thousands in the burial-grounds, it had been destroyed
    by fire, and now it seemed as if the last and crowning misery was to
    be inflicted upon it. Men’s hearts sank within them. They asked if
    their afflictions were laid upon them for their persecution of the
    Quakers and the Baptists, for their imprisonment of the saints, for
    the idolatries of the Court, and the corruption of the times. For it
    was known on that day that the Dutch had sailed up the Medway and
    burned the English men-of-war which were lying there, either without
    a crew or with half their company discharged. For defence—an ignoble
    defence—ships were sunk in the bed of the Thames at Barking, Woolwich,
    and Blackwall. Every able-bodied man in the City was called out.
    Had the Dutch continued, they must have been able to take the City.
    Luckily they did not continue, and the Treaty of Breda put an end to
    hostilities.
  </p>

  <p>
    The City at this time returned to the mediæval use of passing long and
    intricate regulations for the better management of the markets. The
    most noteworthy provisions were two: that the Market Bell should ring
    at six every morning, at which the market was to open <em>for housekeepers
    only</em> and such as bought for their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
    own use; at ten the bell was to
    ring again, at which time retailers and those who bought to sell again
    should be allowed to enter.
  </p>

  <p>
    Was the Temple within the City and its Liberties or not? The question
    was answered in a practical manner by the Lord Mayor in March 1669,
    when, with the Aldermen, he went to dine with the Reader of the Inner
    Temple. He claimed that it was within his jurisdiction, and ordered
    his sword-bearer to precede him carrying the sword up. The students,
    as sticklers for the honour of the Temple, came out and ordered him to
    lower the sword; they tried to snatch the sword away; they hustled the
    marshal’s men and compelled the Mayor and Aldermen to take refuge in
    the chambers of the Auditor Phillips while the Recorder and Sheriffs
    hastened to Whitehall in order to lay the matter before the King. It
    is not stated what message was sent by the King, but when the Sheriffs
    came back and the Mayor attempted to get away there was another fight,
    and the Aldermen were treated with the greatest disrespect. They again
    retreated to the Chambers and again sent to the King. When the Sheriffs
    returned, however, the students had gone to dinner and the unfortunate
    civic procession was enabled to get out in an extremely undignified
    manner.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 1670 an Act of Parliament was passed suppressing conventicles. The
    Act was carried out with great rigour; but the meeting-houses were
    handed over to the Church of England to be used as churches until the
    parish churches themselves should be rebuilt.
  </p>

  <p>
    The attempted robbery of the Tower by Blood in 1671 may be mentioned
    on account of the extraordinary interest excited everywhere by the
    audacity of the crime. Otherwise it belongs to the history of the
    country rather than to that of the City. There was whispering on
    Change, murmurs and rumblings of discontent when it became known that
    the man had not only received the King’s pardon, but also the King’s
    favour and a grant of land. But, in fact, during the whole of this
    reign, in which the King was encroaching as much as he dared, having
    learned nothing from his father’s fate, and the City was defending her
    liberties now feebly, now strongly, the air was filled with murmurs of
    discontent and with whispers of approaching rebellion. It was as if an
    impending earthquake announced its coming by subterranean rumblings.
    How much the King heard and understood, how far he was prepared, if
    necessary, for a new appeal to the sword, it is for the historian of
    the country to investigate.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a means of compensating those loyal and necessitous officers who had
    suffered for their adherence to the Royalist cause, Charles granted
    them one or more plate lotteries. Thus he presented the officers with
    certain plate as a gift from the Crown; they were authorised to put it
    up in lottery by tickets which were sold for the purpose. Thus, if the
    plate was worth, say £1000, tickets to the value of £3000 were issued,
    ensuring a large profit to the proprietor if all the tickets were sold.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span></p>

  <p>
    We have now to consider the treatment of London by the King during
    the latter part of his reign. One may ask with amazement how the
    City, which had deposed Richard the Second for acts not nearly so
    arbitrary as those of Charles the Second, which had driven Charles
    the First from the throne for attempts far less despotic, could sit
    down in submission, nay, almost without a protest, under tyrannies and
    encroachments which indicated the determination to recognise neither
    liberty nor privilege.
  </p>

  <p>
    The bankers of the Middle Ages were the great merchants, the merchant
    adventurers. Whittington held money for the landowners, advanced money
    on the security of land, and in nearly all respects carried on the
    business of a private bank. The merchant adventurers, who were mostly
    mercers, were succeeded by the goldsmiths, who were private bankers,
    kept the money of their customers—“running cash”—gave them cheques
    under the name of “goldsmiths’ notes,” received money on deposit
    account and gave interest for it; they made their own profits by
    lending it out at higher interest. The customers were allowed 6 per
    cent at twenty days’ sale and 3-1/2 per cent for money on demand. The
    bankers took assignments of the public revenue for payment of principal
    and interest as it came in.
  </p>

  <p>
    Of these bankers the most important was Edward Blackwell. He was the
    King’s intermediary in many important transactions. The pay of the
    troops in Dunkirk passed through his hands; he went to France on
    business for the King; he advanced money to the King, who owed him
    in 1672 more than a quarter of a million. There were nearly forty
    goldsmiths and bankers in Lombard Street. The money these bankers had
    lent to the Exchequer on security of the public revenue amounted to
    £1,300,000. In the year 1671 Charles wanted money. He was about to
    enter upon the war with Holland. Parliament was prorogued; he would
    always get money, if he could, without going to the House for it. In
    this case he listened to the advice of Clifford and took a step, the
    nature of which, one would hope, he did not comprehend. He resolved
    upon closing the Exchequer. The meaning of this step is perhaps not
    at once intelligible. It means that the repayments due to those who
    had lent money to the Exchequer were withheld, and it means that the
    interest due on these loans was refused payment. Imagine, if you can,
    the consternation and the despair which would be spread around if
    the interest on Bank of England Stock, or the London County Council
    Debt, or any other large security were to be suddenly stopped at the
    present day! Charles laid his hands on the whole amount. He took it.
    He promised to resume payment within a year, with interest. He took
    this money. And yet the City did not rise! Blackwell, with all the
    goldsmiths in Lombard Street, was ruined. Those rich bankers who had
    placed all their money in the King’s hands were utterly ruined; so were
    the lesser folk, the hundreds of people who had entrusted their money
    to the bankers of Lombard Street.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span></p>

  <p>
    Not even Henry the Third, not even Richard the Second, ever inflicted
    such a blow as this upon the City. In money of our day, and considering
    the poverty of the City, it represents at least £6,000,000—nay, more,
    because the interest was then more than double that of the present day,
    say £8,000,000. Imagine the rage and consternation were such a blow to
    be delivered at the Bank of England! Imagine the consternation if there
    were to be no interest on a great part of the National Debt for a whole
    year! Nay, the blow was far greater, because London two hundred years
    ago was far, far less wealthy than at present, not only actually, but
    in proportion to its population. Looking on London only as a trading
    community it is quite certain that such a blow could never be forgiven.
    When the opportunity should arise it would be remembered. It was not
    his religion only that drove James from Whitehall, it was the memory
    of this act of confiscation and the other acts of oppression which
    followed.
  </p>

  <p>
    The absence of resistance is at first sight most remarkable. I can
    only account for this fact on the theory that the poverty of the City
    and its weakness were much greater than is generally supposed. The
    Plague, which swept away many thousands of bread-winners, left behind
    it many thousands of penniless orphans. The Fire, which spared the
    lives of the people, destroyed all they owned in the world: house,
    furniture, stock in trade, tools, everything. The long civil wars
    had helped to impoverish the City; the Dutch War was calamitous; in
    other words, the City for many years had been living on its capital,
    and now this was coming to an end. Again, the religious dissensions
    of the City contributed to its weakness. It was the influence of the
    Church of England which brought back the King; it was therefore with
    an ill grace that they complained of the Royal exactions. The Church
    of England had joined in persecuting the Nonconformists just as, in
    the fifties, the Independents and the Presbyterians had joined in
    persecuting the Anglicans. Moreover, from many a pulpit in the City,
    day after day, the doctrine—the monstrous suicidal doctrine—of passive
    obedience was preached. The “Judgment and Decree” of Oxford, issued a
    few years later, was already on the lips of the High Church preachers.
    It declared to be “false, seditious, and impious, even heretical and
    blasphemous,” to hold that “authority is derived from the people;
    that if lawful governors become tyrants, they forfeit their right
    of governing; that the King hath but a co-ordinate right with the
    other two estates, the Lords and the Commons, etc.,” and that passive
    obedience is “the badge and character of the Church of England.”
  </p>

  <p>
    The secret of the submission of the City under so many blows was
    therefore (1) its poverty, (2) its internal dissensions, (3) the
    doctrine of passive obedience inculcated by so many of the clergy.
    Perhaps there was still some memory among middle-aged men of the sour
    austerities enforced during the Commonwealth.
  </p>

  <p>
    Many of the natural leaders of the City, those of the merchants who
    were still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
    in good circumstances, had withdrawn from the scene of
    certain strife and possible disaster; they had taken houses in the
    suburbs, especially those on the north and the east of the town. One
    result was that their houses stood unoccupied. At this time we begin to
    find the suburbs becoming the place of residence for City merchants;
    at first the favourite quarters were in and about Stepney. Many
    substantial houses were built in the midst of large gardens at Mile
    End, Hoxton, Hackney, Ratcliffe, and Norton Folgate.
  </p>

  <p>
    In February 1674 the general complaints about trade were so loud that
    an attempt was made to seek redress from the Parliament. A petition,
    setting forth the miserable condition of the City, was drawn up and
    presented on February 23. Nothing was done, however, and on the 24th
    the House was prorogued.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the year 1675 compliments and presents passed between the King and
    the City, noticeable only as showing the apparently unabated loyalty of
    the City, and in 1677 the City offered a magnificent entertainment to
    the King and Queen, the Duke of York, the Princesses Mary and Anne, and
    the Prince of Orange, to celebrate the betrothal of the Princess Mary.
  </p>

  <p>
    After the regulation of the Provision Markets the Common Council turned
    their attention to the Cloth Market and produced a set of regulations
    which, one may confidently assume, could never have been mastered by
    the honest vendors of cloth. They may be found set forth at length in
    Maitland’s <cite>History</cite>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then followed one of those dreary disputes which can hardly be read
    with patience. It was the old question whether the Court of Aldermen
    had the power to veto the decisions and orders of the Common Council.
    How was it ended? I quote the words of Sharpe (<cite>London and the
    Kingdom</cite>, ii. p. 454):—
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “One result of the <i xml:lang="fr">contretemps</i> which had occurred in the Court
      of Common Council of the 12th March was that the Court of Aldermen
      resolved to retain certain counsel to advise them as occasion
      should arise on the question of their rights and privileges, and
      to create a fund by subscription among themselves to meet the
      necessary expenses.
    </p>

    <p>
      In April the Town Clerk and the Four Clerks of the outer court
      (<i xml:lang="la">i.e.</i> mayor’s court) were instructed to search the books and
      records of the city on the question whether or not it was the
      province of the lord mayor (1) to direct and put the question in
      the Common Council, (2) to name committees, and (3) to nominate
      persons to be put in election to any office. This last point
      especially affected the right claimed by the Mayor to nominate (if
      not to elect) one of the sheriffs by virtue of his prerogative—a
      claim which had already been more than once canvassed, and which
      was destined shortly to bring the City and the Crown into violent
      opposition.
    </p>

    <p>
      On the 7th September 1675 the Court of Aldermen directed that
      the opinion of counsel should be taken on the power of the mayor
      and aldermen to put their veto on matters passed by the Common
      Council. After the lapse of fifteen months the opinions of Sir
      William Jones, the attorney-general, Sir Francis Winnington,
      solicitor-general, Sir John Maynard and Sir Francis Pemberton,
      sergeants-at-law, and of ‘Mr. William Steele’ (<em>not</em> a former
      Recorder of that name as some have supposed) were presented to
      the court (5th Dec. 1676); and with the exception of the last
      mentioned, all the lawyers declared in favour of the mayor and
      aldermen. There the matter was allowed to rest for a year or more
      until in February 1678 the opinions of Sir William Dolben, not long
      since appointed the city’s Recorder, and of Jeffreys, the Common
      Sergeant, who was destined in a few months to succeed Dolben on the
      latter’s promotion to the bench, were taken and found to coincide
      with the opinions already delivered with the exception of that of
      William Steele.”

    On the termination of the French war, Charles asked the City to lend
    him another £200,000. The City consented amid gloomy forebodings.
    What did the King want with the money? What was he going to do with
    it? Would he introduce foreign troops and so destroy the liberties of
    the people? It is a singular illustration of the affection which the
    City is said to have always entertained for Charles that these things
    should have been whispered about. It was not affection, it was fear.
    This Prince, whom we suppose to have been always under the influence
    of women, always wallowing in pleasure, had proved himself a strong
    man and a crafty man; he showed when he seized that money, not only
    his own strength, but also the weakness of the City. He did what he
    pleased with them, and he continued to do what he pleased with them
    as long as he lived. In one point, however, Charles was powerless; he
    could not abolish the national hatred and suspicion of the Catholics.
    The Popish Plot, invented by Titus Oates, drove the City into a state
    of panic meaningless and causeless. Sir Edmondbury Godfrey was found
    dead on Primrose Hill the day after he had received the deposition of
    Titus Oates. Murdered by the Papists of course! Why, then, did they
    not murder Titus Oates himself? No one felt safe. The City gates were
    closed, the streets were protected by post and chains, the City was in
    a state of siege, with no enemy in sight or existence.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the year 1679 the King was attacked by fever, and for some time
    was believed to be in danger. The City realised, then, at least, that
    his successor was a Catholic. Therefore when Charles recovered, the
    joybells and the bonfires represented much more than a common and
    perfunctory rejoicing. The King recovered, and made haste to show
    the true nature of his sentiments towards the City. He was very much
    annoyed by the presentation of a number of petitions from all parts
    of the country, including London, in favour of calling a Parliament.
    He went so far as to prohibit (December 1672) “tumultuous petitions,”
    the adjective meaning petitions such as might lead to civil war.
    Notwithstanding this prohibition the City of London dared to present
    another petition urging his Majesty “for the preservation of his royal
    person and government, and the Protestant religion, he would graciously
    please to order that parliament, his Great Council, might assemble and
    sit to take measures against the machinations of Rome.”
  </p>

  <p>
    When, in November 1680, the House did meet, the City sent up another
    petition. They urged the King to lend an ear to the advice tendered by
    the House for his own safety and the preservation of the Protestant
    religion; “they promised to be ready at all times to promote his
    Majesty’s ease and prosperity, and to stand by him against all dangers
    and hazards whatsoever.”
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span></p>

  <p>
    The deputation which presented the petition were bluntly told to go
    home and mind their own business.
  </p>

  <p>
    Six months later the City presented another petition expressing
    surprise at the prorogation of the House, “whereby the prosecution of
    the public justice of the kingdom has received an interruption,” and
    prayed that the House might resume its sessions on the day to which
    it had been prorogued as being “the only means to quiet the minds and
    extinguish the fears of your Protestant subjects.” The King’s answer
    was the dissolution of Parliament, and the announcement that he would
    call another for March 1 to sit at Oxford.

  <p>
    All this anxiety meant that the Duke of York was not to succeed if he
    could be kept out. And Charles, for his part, was not going to take any
    steps to prevent the succession of his brother.
  </p>

  <p>
    There were, however, other instruments at work to keep up the
    anti-Papal feeling. Chief among these was the King’s Head Club. The
    King’s Head Tavern stood over against the Inner Temple. The members
    of the Club were at first Lord Shaftesbury’s friends, but others,
    especially young men of good family, were admitted. In order to be
    known by each other they wore a green ribbon in their hats. Their
    principal discourse turned upon the perils of Popery. The true purpose
    of the founders was to foster the anti-Catholic spirit, and to keep it
    alive and strong enough to prevent the succession of James. Among other
    things, for instance, they got up processions, in which the Pope was
    carried in effigy with two or three devils to
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span> decorate his chair. In
    the end Pope, devils, and all were tumbled into the bonfire.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Oxford House of Commons lasted a week only. The City presented
    another address of remonstrance. For a second time they were told to
    mind their own business.
  </p>

  <p>
    When a really clever thing is done in the name of the King he always
    gets the credit of the cleverness. The reduction of the City into a
    collection of men and women without rights, liberties, or government,
    other than what the King might grant and allow, was a piece of work
    which reflects the highest credit on whoever devised it, designed it,
    or carried it out.
  </p>

  <p>
    The last years of Charles’s reign were occupied in a determined and
    a successful effort to reduce the Corporation to submission and to
    make it, so to speak, a pocket borough. In these efforts he completely
    succeeded. Where the first Charles had failed, the second Charles
    succeeded.
  </p>

  <p>
    The petitions of the Corporation were counterbalanced by others from
    the Borough of Southwark, from the Lieutenancy of London, and from
    20,000 ’prentices to the opposite effect.
  </p>

  <p>
    The last of these petitions gave the greatest pleasure to the Court.
    The loyal ’prentices were rewarded with a splendid banquet given to
    them in the Merchant Taylors’ Hall. The Duke of Grafton, the Earl of
    Mulgrave, Lord Hyde, and Sir Joseph Williamson acted as stewards, and
    1500 tickets were given away among those who had signed the petition.
    The tickets contained the following invitation: “You are invited, and
    desired, by the Right Honourable and others of the stewards, elected
    at a meeting of the loyal young men and addressers, July 28, 1682, to
    take a dinner (together with other loyal young freemen and apprentices
    of the City of London) at Merchant Taylors’ Hall, on Wednesday the 9th
    of this instant August, at 12 o’clock.” The King himself, to grace the
    board, sent a brace of “very good bucks.” They were carried into the
    City upright in a cart, stuck with boughs. Three thousand sat down to
    this entertainment.
  </p>

  <p>
    Charles, in fact, discovered with joy that there were two parties in
    the City, and that the loyal party was apparently of strength nearly
    equal to the “country” party He resolved, therefore, so to manage the
    conduct of the City as to bring the election of all the officers into
    the hands of the Royalists—that is to say, into his own hands. The
    contest began with the election of the Sheriffs.
  </p>

  <p>
    There had been many attempts made from the commencement of the
    fourteenth century to take away the election of the Sheriffs from
    the Commonalty. But in 1347 the Mayor obtained the right, or took
    the right, of nominating and electing one of the Sheriffs, while the
    Commonalty elected the other. For 300 years this right was exercised,
    either without opposition or with faint grumblings.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Lord Mayor continued to exercise this right for 300 years. In the
    year<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
    1641, when everything began to be questioned, the Commonalty
    protested against this custom. The question was referred by the King to
    the House of Lords, who refused to settle it, ordering that for that
    year the Mayor’s nominee should be chosen by the Commonalty, without
    prejudice to the Mayor’s right in the matter.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here, then, was established a very pretty ground of quarrel. For the
    next nine years the Mayor continued to nominate and the Commonalty
    continued to protest. Then for the following nine years the Mayor
    abandoned his privilege. But it still remained open for him to claim
    it and to exercise it. In fact, in 1662 he did both. The Commonalty
    protested but elected his man. For seven years after this the Mayor
    continued to exercise his right. In 1674, however, the Common Council
    appointed a Committee to investigate the case. The Mayor drank, as
    usual, to the man whom he chose. The Committee recommended an Act of
    Common Council to settle the question. No such Act was passed.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 1680 the question proceeded to the acute stage. It was just before
    the discovery by Charles of the strong Court party in the City.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Mayor nominated one Hockenhall, who refused to serve, and paid his
    fine. The Commons therefore elected Slingsby Bethel and Henry Cornish,
    both men of the Puritan party, and the former a strong republican and
    an enemy to everything that looked like feasting and joy. The nominees
    of the Court party who suffered defeat were Box and Nicholson. Cornish
    refused, for instance, to give the customary dinner to the Aldermen. He
    was regarded with great aversion by the Court party for his republican
    tendencies.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the following year the two Sheriffs, Pilkington and Shute, were of
    the same party and were elected against the same Court nominees as in
    the previous year. The King, when the Recorder and the two Sheriffs
    waited upon him, expressed in the presence of the latter the fact that
    they were personally unwelcome to him.
  </p>

  <p>
    One would think that the Common Council had had enough rebuffs over
    their petitions. But they drew up another, which they presented to the
    King, with the same result as before.
  </p>

  <p>
    In September 1681 the Court party got a Mayor of their own, one
    Sir John Moore. It was their first success. The King expressed his
    satisfaction at the election of so loyal and worthy a magistrate.
    And, in order to mark his sense of the late elections of Sheriffs, he
    issued, in January 1682, a writ calling upon the citizens to show by
    what warrant they claimed their liberties and franchises:—
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “These were (1) the right to be of themselves a body corporate and
      politic, by the name of mayor, commonalty and citizens of the city
      of London, (2) the right to have sheriffs of the city and county
      of London and county of Middlesex, and to name, elect, make and
      constitute them, and (3) the right of the mayor and aldermen of the
      city to be justices of the peace and hold Sessions of the Peace”
      (<cite>Sharpe</cite>, ii. 477).
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    The City received the writ much as their ancestors had received notice
    of an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
    Iter. It was troublesome, but it was lawyers’ work. They were
    not afraid of having exercised any usurpation of rights; let the
    lawyers deal with it. The lawyers, therefore, took it in hand for a
    time, and while they prepared the case, matters rested.
  </p>

  </div>

  <p>
    Meantime the people of the City were ranged definitely into two
    factions; on the one side were those who stood for rights and
    liberties; for toleration of religion—it was notorious that they would
    have no toleration while they were in power—and for Parliamentary
    government. This party contained the better class of citizens,
    the merchants, the responsible citizens, and the whole of the
    Nonconformists. The other party, which remembered the severe times
    when the theatres<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
    were closed and dancing and singing were criminal
    offences, contained the most of the clergy of the Church of England,
    all the Catholics, all those who were connected with the old Royalist
    families, and that powerful body, the ’prentices of London.
  </p>

  <p>
    The former party was under the leadership of Pilkington; the latter
    under that of the Lord Mayor.
  </p>

  <p>
    The shrievalty of Pilkington was terminated in an extremely
    disagreeable manner by the Duke of York bringing an action against him
    for libel. The Sheriff was accused of saying that the Duke had burned
    down the City and was going to cut the throats of the citizens. The
    Duke had little cause to be friendly with the City, where his portrait
    had been cut and hacked, and where such things were openly said about
    him. At the same time it was a vindictive action, and one which he did
    not dare to have tried in a City court. He removed it, one knows not
    by what authority, to the county of Hertford, where it was heard by a
    packed jury. It is quite uncertain whether Pilkington uttered the words
    attributed to him. Alderman Sir Henry Tulse and Sir William Hooker
    swore that he did say these words. Sir Patience Ward swore that if
    the words were said, it was before Pilkington’s arrival on the scene.
    However, there was no hesitation on the part of the jury. They found
    for the plaintiff with £100,000 damages.
  </p>

  <p>
    The name of Pilkington belongs to two or three Protestant champions of
    a somewhat earlier time. Thomas Pilkington, born about 1620, the son
    of a country gentleman of good family, like so many London citizens,
    was probably related to, or descended from, James Pilkington, Bishop
    of Durham, Leonard Pilkington, Master of St. John’s, Cambridge,
    and Richard Pilkington, Archdeacon of Leicester; all these were
    controversialists in their generation. Thomas Pilkington, therefore,
    had Protestantism in his blood. He was Master of the Skinners’ Company,
    one of the City members, Alderman of Farringdon Without, and, as we
    have seen, Sheriff in 1681.
  </p>

  <p>
    He was a marked man at Court; not only did he never disguise his
    principles, but entertained at his house Shaftesbury, Essex, and other
    leaders of the Whig party.
  </p>

  <p>
    On hearing the result of the libel case he made no effort to escape but
    quietly surrendered to the bail, was committed to prison, and resigned
    his aldermanry, to which Sheriff North succeeded. He remained in prison
    four years, when the King released him. Sir Patience Ward, for giving
    evidence in his favour, was proceeded against for perjury and found
    guilty. Like Lord Shaftesbury he took refuge in Holland.
  </p>

  <p>
    To complete the history of Pilkington. When the opportunity arrived
    he did his best to send James on his travels and to welcome William;
    he was reinstated in his office of Alderman; he was three times Lord
    Mayor, and at his first installation banquet he entertained the King
    and Queen.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span></p>

  <p>
    Before the trial which condemned him, Pilkington had to take his part
    in the election of the new Sheriffs, June 24, 1682.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was not to be thought that the Lord Mayor would neglect his
    opportunity of securing one of the Sheriffs for his own side. He
    therefore drank to one Dudley North, and issued a precept to the
    companies to meet for the purpose of informing his nominee and electing
    another Sheriff. The following is his letter (<cite>Maitland</cite>, i. p. 474):—
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“<span class="smcap">By the Mayor.</span></p>

    <p>
      “These are to require you, That on Midsummer-Day next, being the
      Day appointed as well for Confirmation of the Person
      <span class="smcap">WHO HATH BEEN BY ME CHOSEN</span>,
      according to the ancient Custom and
      Constitution of this City, to be one of the Sheriffs of this City
      and County of Middlesex for the Year ensuing, as for the Election
      of the other of the said Sheriffs, and other officers, you cause
      the Livery of your Company to meet together at your common Hall
      early in the Morning, and from thence to come together decently
      and orderly in their Gowns to Guildhall, there to make the said
      Confirmation and Election. Given the Nineteenth of June, 1682.
    </p>

    <p class="rightinset">
      <span class="smcap">John Moor.</span>”<br />
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    On Midsummer Day, we read, the Liverymen assembled in the Guildhall
    in great numbers. When the Mayor and Aldermen were arrived upon the
    Hustings, the Common Crier made proclamation: “You Gentlemen of the
    Livery of London, attend your Confirmation;” upon which there arose
    a tumult of voices crying, “No Confirmation! No Confirmation!” and
    so continued for half an hour. The Recorder at last procured silence
    and made a speech upon their privileges. The Lord Mayor and Aldermen
    then withdrew, and the Common Serjeant offered to speak amid cries of
    “Election! Election! To the Day’s Work!”
  </p>

  <p>
    The question of confirmation was shelved, and there were put in
    nomination for Sheriffs, Dudley North and Ralph Box, of the Court side,
    and Thomas Papillon and John Dubois, of the other side.
  </p>

  <p>
    On a show of hands the two latter had an enormous majority. But a poll
    was demanded. It was noticed that a great many persons were present
    who had no right of entry, not being citizens; they carried swords and
    insulted the Liverymen and endeavoured to make a disturbance. In this
    they were unsuccessful. About seven in the evening the Lord Mayor came
    to the Hall and ordered all to depart till three days later. But the
    Sheriffs took no notice of this order and continued the Poll, hoping to
    finish that day. At nine o’clock, there being three or four thousand
    people in the Guildhall, the Sheriff closed for the day, and adjourned
    the Poll till the Tuesday following (it was then Saturday).
  </p>

  <p>
    So the Sheriffs went home, followed by crowds crying out “God bless the
    Protestant Sheriffs! God bless Papillon and Dubois!” This was construed
    into a riot, for which the Sheriffs Pilkington and Shute were committed
    to the Tower, but immediately afterwards admitted to bail. On the 1st
    of July they met at Common Hall, and refusing to obey the order of the
    Lord Mayor to adjourn the meeting, declared Papillon and Dubois duly
    elected Sheriffs.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span></p>

  <p>
    Had the Sheriffs the right to ignore the Mayor’s orders? That remained
    to be proved. Meantime on the 7th the Mayor repaired to the Guildhall
    to carry on the Poll, taking no notice of the Sheriffs’ proceedings.
    There was a dispute, naturally, and the Mayor adjourned the Hall until
    the 11th.
  </p>

  <p>
    The matter was laid before the King, who decided that a new election
    should take place. Sharpe gives two versions of what took place at this
    new election.
  </p>

  <p>
    According to the official account, Dudley North was duly confirmed and
    gave his consent to take office. On taking votes for the other three,
    Papillon had 60 voices, Dubois 60, and Box 1244. Therefore Box was
    elected.
  </p>

  <p>
    According to a tract of the time, a separate poll was opened on the
    same day by the Sheriffs; all four candidates were submitted to the
    Hall. Only 107 voted for the confirmation of North, and 2414 against
    it. After the declaration of this result the Mayor caused the reading
    of the other, which caused so great an uproar that the Mayor and
    Aldermen left the Hall, and the Sheriffs declared Papillon and Dubois
    duly elected.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then petitions were drawn up, praying that as Papillon and Dubois had
    been duly elected, the Court would call them; also that a <i xml:lang="la">caveat</i>
    should be entered against North and Box being admitted. The Mayor
    returned an evasive answer. The huge majority in favour of Box at the
    Mayor’s poll is explained by a remark of Maitland, that nobody voted
    for Papillon and Dubois because they had already carried them at the
    Sheriffs’ poll.
  </p>

  <p>
    Box at this point retired, paying the fine. The Mayor therefore
    ordered another Common Hall for the election of his successor, and
    put forward one Peter Rich. There was a great tumult in the Hall. The
    people shouted for their own men, Papillon and Dubois; the Mayor, going
    through the ceremony in dumb show, declared Rich duly elected. He then
    dissolved the Common Hall and went home. Then the Sheriffs proceeded to
    open the Poll, and found 2082 votes in favour of their former choice,
    and only 35 for Rich.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Sheriffs—who were still Pilkington and Shute—proclaimed the result
    of the Poll, and the election of Papillon and Dubois.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then the Mayor and some of the Aldermen went to Whitehall and informed
    the King what had happened. The Sheriffs were summoned before the
    Council. They were ordered to enter in their own recognizances for
    £1000.
  </p>

  <p>
    Two days afterwards Rich and North were sworn in as Sheriffs, the
    Guildhall being guarded by the trained bands. It was ominous of the
    feeling in the City that the Mercers’ Company, to which North belonged,
    refused to pay him the common compliment of going with him to the
    Guildhall on entering upon office.
  </p>

  <p>
    So far the Court had won. They now had the Lord Mayor and the Sheriffs;
    the next thing was to secure the successor to the Mayoralty.
  </p>

  <p>
    This was done, apparently, by making a false return of the votes. Four
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
    Aldermen were put up. The Poll placed first and second on the list Gold
    and Cornish, both belonging to the popular side. A scrutiny was made
    by the Court of Aldermen (October 24) that maintained this result, but
    the Mayor, on the 25th, brought in a result which put Pritchard, a
    man of the Court party, at the head of the list. It is true that the
    first difference between Gold and Pritchard was only 56, so that a very
    little manipulation was required.
  </p>

  <p>
    In order to obtain a Royalist Common Council, Charles ordered that none
    should be elected who had not conformed to the Corporation Act.
  </p>

  <p>
    In February 1683 the hearing of the <i xml:lang="la">Quo Warranto</i> case came on. The
    points at issue have already been detailed. The pleadings in the case
    may be found in Maitland.
  </p>

  <p>The following judgment was pronounced by Mr. Justice Jones on June 12:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “That a city might forfeit its Charter; that the Malversations of
      the Common Council were the Acts of the whole City; and that the
      two Points set forth in the Pleadings were just grounds for the
      forfeiting of a Charter. Upon which Premises the proper Conclusion
      seemed to be, That therefore the City of London had forfeited their
      Charter.”
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    The Attorney-General moved that the judgment might not be recorded.
    After this judgment the City was greatly astonished and perplexed. The
    popular party wanted to enter the judgment and to leave the King to do
    what he pleased. The Court party were for absolute surrender of their
    liberties and submission to the King. Maitland gives in full a paper
    which was circulated at that time, showing what would be lost if the
    City surrendered its Charter:—
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “There being so great a Murmur, and so much discourse, that the
      Charter of this City of London is to be made forfeit, or else
      surrendered by a Common Council, ’tis fit for every member of this
      City to understand, that the Meaning or Intent of such a Forfeiture
      or Surrender, is to dissolve the Body Corporate or Politic of the
      City, to spoil it irrecoverably of all its antient Government,
      Laws, Customs and Rights, which have been its glory throughout
      Europe near two thousand Years, to bring it into the same State
      with the Country Villages, only capable to be created a new Body
      politick by the Grace and Favour of his Majesty, and to obtain such
      Privileges as the Crown can grant, which are infinitely inferior to
      the Customs, Franchises, Rights and Government it now holds by the
      Laws and Statutes of the Kingdom.
    </p>

    <p>
      If then there be any Danger either of a Forfeiture or Surrender
      of this City’s Charter, every Member of it is concerned, not only
      in Interest, but in Duty, to contribute what Assistance he can to
      perserve and secure it.
    </p>

    <p>
      For that Purpose every Citizen upon taking his Freedom is sworn to
      maintain the Franchise and customs of the City, and to keep the
      City harmless, to his Power; and whatsoever Citizen shall openly
      attempt, or privately contrive, the Destruction of the Corporation,
      its Customs, or Franchises, betrays the Community, and violates his
      said oath, from which no Power on Earth can absolve.”
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    The writer then enumerates all the rights, privileges, and possessions
    which the City would lose, never to regain them again, and concludes:—
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “The death of a Corporation reduceth it to nothing; and ’twill then
      be, as if it had never been, in respect of Debts or Credits; there
      can be no Successor, Heir, or Executor to demand or answer for the
      Body that was.
    </p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span></p>

    <p>
      Therefore all the Goods and Chatels of the City must fall to the
      King, to be given and disposed of, as he pleaseth.
    </p>

    <p>
      And all its Lands and real Estate in the Exchange, Guildhall, etc.,
      must of right revert unto the Heirs of the Donors, if there be any,
      or escheat to the Crown, for want of such Heirs.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the Face of Confusion is so full of Horror, that will appear
      after the Dissolution of this mighty Body by Forfeiture or
      Surrender of its Charter, that I tremble to look upon it afar off.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Lord Cook says, It would require a Volume of itself to treat
      of the great and notable Franchises, Liberties and Customs of this
      City. And no less a Volume would be necessary to describe the
      Disorders, Losses, Distractions, Mischiefs and Confusions that must
      attend the Destruction and the Death of so great a Body Politick.
    </p>

    <p>
      And the City of London by this Means, which is now one of the
      antientest Cities in the whole World, will at the time of such
      Surrender be the youngest City and Corporation in England”
      (<cite>Maitland</cite>, i. pp. 481, 482).
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>However, the City submitted.</p>

  <p>
    They were informed by the Lord Keeper that the King accepted their
    submission in consideration of the many loyal citizens in London, but
    with conditions, which were as follows:—
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “1. That no Lord Mayor, Sheriff, Recorder, Common-Serjeant,
      Town-Clerk, or Coroner of the City of London, or Steward of the
      Borough of Southwark, shall be capable of, or admitted to, the
      Exercise of their respective Offices, before his Majesty shall have
      approved them under his Sign Manual.
    </p>

    <p>
      2. That, if his Majesty shall disapprove the Choice of any Person
      to be Lord Mayor, and signify the same under his Sign-Manual to the
      Lord Mayor, or, in default of a Lord Mayor, to the Recorder, or
      senior Alderman, the Citizens shall within one Week proceed to a
      new Choice. And, if his Majesty shall in like Manner disapprove the
      second Choice, his Majesty may, if he please, nominate a Person to
      be Lord Mayor for the ensuing Year.
    </p>

    <p>
      3. If his Majesty shall, in like Manner, disapprove the Persons
      chosen to be Sheriffs, or either of them, his Majesty may appoint
      Persons to be Sheriffs for the ensuing Year by his Commission, if
      so he please.
    </p>

    <p>
      4. That the Lord Mayor, and Court of Aldermen may also, with the
      Leave of his Majesty, displace any Alderman, Recorder, etc.,
      <i xml:lang="la">ut supra</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
      5. Upon the Election of an Alderman, if the Court of Aldermen shall
      judge and declare the Person presented to be unfit, the Ward shall
      chuse again; and, upon a Disapproval of a second Choice, the Court
      may appoint another in his Room.
    </p>

    <p>
      6. The Justices of the Peace are to be by the King’s Commission;
      and the settling of these matters to be left to his Majesty’s
      Attorney and Solicitor-General, and Council learned in Law.”
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    The City were also informed that if they accepted these conditions
    all would be well with them. If, on the other hand, they refused, the
    Attorney-General would enter upon judgment on the following Saturday.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Court of Common Council was called to consider the propositions.
    Some of them declared that rather than accept such slavish conditions
    they would sacrifice everything. But, by a majority of eighteen, the
    conditions were accepted.
  </p>

  <p>
    While these things were going on Papillon obtained a writ of Latitat
    on an action upon this case against the Mayor, Dudley North, and some
    of the Aldermen. They were all served with this writ by one Brown, an
    attorney, and a clerk to the Skinners’ Company. He not only served
    them with the writ, but he arrested them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
    all and carried them off to
    Skinners’ Hall, where he kept them as prisoners till one o’clock in the
    morning. He was then, however, himself arrested for debt and carried
    off to the Compter, so that the prisoners were able to walk home.
  </p>

  <p>
    This story to my mind, untrained in legal subtleties, is mysterious.
    By whose authority could the chief magistrate of the City be arrested
    within his own jurisdiction? And why did the Lord Mayor, the Sheriff,
    and the Aldermen go meekly in the custody of an attorney-clerk to a
    City company?
  </p>

  <p>
    The conclusion of the story, however, is an action brought by Pritchard
    when his time of office was expired. It was heard before Judge
    Jeffreys, and resulted in damages against Papillon of £10,000. He
    therefore made haste to put the sea between himself and prison.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then came the question whether the City should voluntarily surrender
    their liberties. The Recorder was strongly against this step; if they
    freely surrendered their liberties there would be no redress open
    to them; if they did not and judgment was entered, they could take
    proceedings by writ of error. Finally, by 103 to 85 it was resolved not
    to surrender.
  </p>

  <p>
    Judgment was therefore entered against the City. The King was now
    therefore absolutely master of the City. He allowed Pritchard to
    continue as Mayor and the two Sheriffs to remain; eight Aldermen were
    dismissed; sixteen were made Justices of the Peace; the Recorder was
    dismissed and another appointed, and Sir Henry Tulse was nominated
    Mayor to succeed Pritchard.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now had Charles the First been clever enough at the outset to secure
    and use for his own interest the Court party in the City, all his
    troubles might have been avoided. On the other hand, had Charles the
    Second begun his reign instead of ending it with the enslaving of
    the City, he might have died the same death as his father, with the
    certainty that there would have been none to lament him. The City was
    not yet, however, made safe; there remained the companies. These also,
    being served with a <i xml:lang="la">Quo Warranto</i>, had to surrender their charters and
    receive new ones with certain trifling conditions.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have said nothing of the national aspect of this struggle. Let us
    remind ourselves that the conquest of London was only part of the
    conquest of the kingdom; that the triumph of despotism in London was
    accompanied by the triumph of despotism in the country. The country
    party was broken up. Shaftesbury had fled; with him many of the London
    merchants; Essex had committed suicide; Lord Russell and Algernon
    Sidney had been executed; Monmouth had fled. The towns attacked, like
    London, with <i xml:lang="la">Quo Warranto</i>, surrendered their charters and received
    them back, with conditions. Oxford had declared for passive obedience.
    All but the most thorough loyalists were excluded from the franchise;
    Charles had the representation of every borough in his own hands. More
    than this, he had an army of 10,000 men.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span></p>

  <p>
    The wonderful ability with which this Revolution was effected may be
    credited to Charles’s ministers; one seems, however, to perceive the
    King’s brain devising and the King’s hand executing the whole. And the
    master-stroke of all was that by which he acquired the whole power; he
    violated no law and executed no overt acts of tyranny. He was using the
    forms and institutions of liberty for the purpose of crushing liberty.
    He did not even restore old abuses; the Star Chamber and the Court of
    High Commission did not reappear. Freedom of the press was granted. The
    Habeas Corpus Act was passed. And the City of London, stripped of all
    real power, retained the form of it, and on the strength of the form
    seemed to preserve the old loyalty and the old personal affection for
    the King who had taken away its powers and its privileges. And this was
    even a more wonderful achievement for Charles than his triumph. Yet the
    loyalty and the affection were but forms and shadows like the ghostly
    form of its liberties left to the City.
  </p>

  <p>
    What the King would have done with his absolute authority one knows
    not, because in the very hour of his success he was stricken down by
    death. I have refrained from speaking much of Charles’s Court, because
    by this time the Court and the City were entirely separate, and were
    drifting apart more and more. Yet one cannot avoid asking what the
    better class of people, what the baser sort, knew of the Court and the
    life led by King Charles and his courtiers. Something of the King’s
    mistresses they knew; witness the well-known story of Nell Gwynne
    and the mob; witness also that other story of the riot in 1668 when
    the ’prentices pulled down and wrecked certain disorderly houses in
    Moorfields, saying that they did “ill in contenting themselves with
    pulling down the little brothels and did not go to pull down the big
    one at Whitehall.” Eight of the rioters were hanged for this offence,
    which did not stop the appearance of the Remonstrance pretending to be
    a petition from the women whose houses had been destroyed to the King’s
    mistresses at Whitehall. But they could not have known the corruption,
    the venality, and the profligacy of Whitehall; that could only be
    learned by the <i xml:lang="fr">habitués</i>; there were no papers to spread the infamy
    abroad; there was no fierce light of journalism thrown upon the King’s
    private life.
  </p>

  <p>
    The general belief concerning the Court of Charles II. is that it
    presented to the world nothing but a long-continued pageant of
    profligacy, extravagance, luxury, waste, and open contempt of morals.
    We remember Evelyn’s often-quoted account of the last Sunday evening
    before the fatal seizure; Pepys tell us what he saw and heard; De
    Grammont’s book is well known to all; the name and the fame and the
    shame of the King’s mistresses are notorious; the men seem devoid of
    honour, and the women match the men. It appears, to one who would
    restore the palace in the days of the Merry Monarch, that all day
    long the courts of Whitehall echo with the tinkling guitar; at every
    window is a light o’ love; below one of these the King converses gaily
    and carelessly; we hear the laughter, loud and coarse, of the titled
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
    harlots; with painted faces and languishing eyes they roll by in their
    coaches; the singing boys practise the latest part song by Tom D’Urfey;
    the courtiers are loud with ribald jest. I suppose that these things
    cannot be denied. It is, however, a great mistake to suppose that there
    was no serious side to the Court. In the first place, it is impossible
    to conduct the business of the kingdom without an immense amount of
    ceremony and state. Charles was not an Edward the Second; there is
    nothing to show that he did not do what was expected of a king with
    as much dignity as his father, even though he did not take himself
    so seriously. There were grave and weighty troubles and difficulties
    in his reign; domestic troubles such as the Fire of London; foreign
    troubles such as the war with the Dutch; the King’s counsellors were
    for the most part grave and serious men. Add to this that every officer
    in the numerous household and following of the King desired and
    expected his rank and dignity to be respected.

  <p>
    There were daily duties to be performed. The King held a levée every
    morning; he went in state to prayers; he received his ministers and
    sat at the Council; he dined in public; the Court was open to any one
    who might venture to claim the rank and consideration of a gentleman;
    the King was accessible to all.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
    The quiet, dull Court of the Georges
    was a new thing altogether in the land. Charles kept open house, like
    the kings of France. He walked fearlessly and almost unattended in
    the Park and in his gardens; one cannot, I repeat, deny the gambling,
    singing, and love-making which the King permitted and encouraged; but
    I plead for Charles that amount of serious attention to his state and
    dignity of his position, no small amount, which was necessary for the
    mere maintenance of kingship. In other things the laxness of his morals
    did not prevent the assertion of his prerogative, especially in his
    dealings with the City of London. No king before him, for instance, had
    dared to inflict upon the City so enormous a fine as that when Charles
    shut up the Exchequer and robbed the merchants of a million and a
    half of money. This one action, so bold, so calculated both as to the
    occasion and the probable impotence of the City to resist it, ought
    to be alone sufficient to set aside completely the old theory of the
    jaded voluptuary. It was not, again, the jaded voluptuary who plotted,
    planned, and carried out the destruction of the City liberties; it was
    a Stuart, with all the cleverness of his race, with all the tenacity of
    his father and his brother, and with all the inability to discern the
    forces that were arrayed against him and to comprehend the certainty
    of their success. He died in the moment of his success, leaving to his
    brother the fruits of his despotic measures in ruin and deposition
    (<i>see</i> <a href="#APPENDIX_I">Appendix I</a>.).

    <span class="smcap">The</span> short reign of James afforded to the City a time of continual
    surprises and ceaseless anxiety, with the corresponding emotions of
    joy, sorrow, disappointment, and despair.
  </p>

  <p>
    The reign began with an assurance that the established government,
    that of Church and State, would be respected and maintained. The
    King, however, showed what he understood by the proclamation when he
    continued to receive the customs which had been settled on Charles
    for life, and which could not be exacted by his successor without
    the assent of Parliament. James announced his intention of speedily
    calling a Parliament at the same time as he proclaimed his continuance
    of taking the customs. In the same illegal way he took over the excise
    duties.

      TITUS OATES FLOGGED AT THE CART TAIL
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    Meantime the Mayor and Aldermen, in accordance with the successful
    craft of Charles, were mostly nominees of the King; they were
    instructed to admit to the liveries of the City Companies none but
    persons of “unquestionable loyalty”; so that, as Charles had provided,
    the whole of the governing bodies in the City were mere creatures of
    the Court.
  </p>

  <p>
    One can hardly be surprised at the arrest and punishment of Titus
    Oates when James succeeded. At the same time to flog a man all the
    way from Aldgate to Newgate, and two days afterwards from Newgate
    to Tyburn, seems, short of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
    tortures of a Damiens,<a id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> the most
    horrible barbarity ever inflicted on a criminal since the time when a
    Roman could flog a slave to death. The first day’s march at the cart
    tail was a mile and a quarter in length; the next was over two miles
    and a half. Titus was flogged the whole way, with an interval of two
    days. If the cart was driven slowly, as was always the case, say at the
    rate of three miles an hour, and if the whip descended fifteen times
    a minute, the wretched man would receive 375 lashes on the first day,
    and two days after he would receive 750 lashes. Perhaps the executioner
    was less rapid in his movements; perhaps the cart moved more quickly.
    Perhaps the executioner was one of the many who still believed in
    the perjured wretch and sympathised with him. Yet even the closest
    friend would have to make a show of laying it on with a will. The man
    survived, showing how much agony a man may suffer before it kills him.

      TITUS OATES IN THE PILLORY
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    Short as was the reign of James, it provided for the Londoners many
    other scenes and dramatic situations.
  </p>

  <p>
    On July 15 the populace gathered together in immense crowds to witness
    the execution of the unfortunate Duke of Monmouth. They brought him out
    of the Tower surrounded by a strong guard, while commanding officers
    had orders to shoot the prisoner should any attempt be made at a
    rescue. This was more than probable, seeing that in the vast concourse
    of people who were collected on Tower Hill, nine out of ten wished in
    their hearts that the Protestant champion had won the day at Sedgemoor,
    while some of them had even been with him on that fatal night, though
    they were by no means anxious that their friends should know the fact.
    The prisoner, still young, still the loveliest man to look upon in the
    three kingdoms, mounted the scaffold; he showed a firm countenance at
    the end. Did any of the spectators ask each other whether this handsome
    face had in it the slightest sign of kinship with the black and dour
    face of Charles? He knelt down; the headsman, trembling, delivered
    three strokes, then threw down the axe and swore he would not go on;
    but, taking up the axe again, in two more strokes severed the head from
    the body. Then the people, sick and sorry, returned to their homes.
  </p>

  <p>
    The fall of Monmouth offered an opening, which James was not likely
    to forego, for the enjoyment of private revenge, and for giving a
    lesson to zealous Protestants. <span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
    Henry Cornish, late Sheriff, had shown
    activity against Catholics on the occasion of the Rye House Plot. Let
    him, therefore, be legally murdered.
  </p>

  <p>
    Henry Cornish was by trade a “factor”; was Alderman of the Ward of
    Bassishaw, and a resident in Cateaton Street. As we have seen, he was
    made Sheriff in 1680 with Slingsby Bethel. The events connected with
    his election were not calculated to make him a <i xml:lang="la">persona grata</i> with the
    Court. He was not only a Whig but a Presbyterian. He was one of the
    five Aldermen chosen for the defence of the civic liberties against
    the <i xml:lang="la">Quo Warranto</i>. In February 1683 Cornish, with Pilkington, Shute,
    Bethel, Sir Thomas Player, the City Chamberlain, and Lord Grey of Wark,
    were brought to trial for the disturbances in June of the preceding
    year. They were all found guilty and all were fined; Cornish, for his
    part, had to pay a fine of 1000 marks. He had already been tricked out
    of his election to the office of Mayor by wholesale tampering with
    the votes. At the time of the Rye House Conspiracy, one John Rumsay,
    arrested on suspicion, offered to give evidence implicating Cornish. At
    the time his offer was not accepted.

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    Then James succeeded. Evidently he regarded Cornish as one of his most
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
    dangerous enemies. He waited until the Monmouth rebellion gave him an
    excuse. There had been an actual rebellion; if it could be proved that
    Cornish had any hand in it, there would be a way of getting rid of him.
  </p>

  <p>
    Monmouth was executed on July 15. Three months passed, during which
    nothing was done to Cornish. This interval was employed, it is now
    certain, in getting up a case against him; we cannot suppose that James
    was ignorant of this plot—it was nothing less—to take the life of the
    sturdy Whig. The man Rumsey found another man, a private enemy to
    Cornish, named Goodenough, to join him in bearing witness which should
    implicate Cornish in the Rye House Plot and show him to be a friend of
    Monmouth. On Tuesday, the 13th of October, Cornish was arrested and
    taken to Newgate. On the Saturday he learned for the first time that he
    was in prison on a charge of high treason, and that he would be tried
    on the Monday. The trial took place accordingly. It was marked by the
    customary brow-beating and bullying. The man must have known that he
    was doomed; the fact that two days only were allowed him to prepare
    his case and bring forward his witnesses might have warned him what to
    expect.

  </div>

  <p>
    <a id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>“His attitude before the judges was calm and dignified. Before
    pleading not guilty to the charge of having consented to aid and abet
    the late Duke of Monmouth and others in their attempt on the life of
    the late King (the Rye House Plot), he entered a protest against the
    indecent haste with which he had been called upon to
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>plead, and the
    short time allowed him to prepare his case. He asked for further time,
    but this the judges refused.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of the chief witnesses for the Crown was Goodenough, who had
    a personal spite against Cornish for his having objected to him
    (Goodenough) serving as under-sheriff in 1680–81, the year when Bethel
    and Cornish were sheriffs. Goodenough had risked his neck in Monmouth’s
    late rebellion, but he had succeeded in obtaining a pardon by promises
    of valuable information against others. With the King’s pardon in his
    pocket he unblushingly declared before the judges that he, as well as
    Cornish and some others, had determined upon a general rising in the
    city at the time of the Rye House Plot. ‘We designed,’ said he, ‘to
    divide it (<i xml:lang="la">i.e.</i> the city) into twenty parts, and out of each part to
    raise five hundred men, if it might be done, to make an insurrection.’
    The Tower was to be seized and the guard expelled.
  </p>

  <p>
    Cornish had been afforded no opportunity for instructing counsel in
    his defence. He was therefore obliged to act as his own counsel,
    with the result usual in such cases. He rested his main defence upon
    the improbability of his having acted as the prosecution endeavoured
    to make out. This he so persistently urged that the judges lost
    patience. Improbability was not enough, they declared; let him call
    his witnesses. When, however, Cornish desired an adjournment, in
    order that he might bring a witness up from Lancashire, his request
    was refused. His chief witness he omitted to call until after the
    Lord Chief Justice had summed up. This man was a vintner of the city,
    named Shephard, at whose house Cornish was charged with having met and
    held consultation with Monmouth and the rest of the conspirators. The
    Bench after some demur assented to the prisoner’s earnest prayer that
    Shephard’s evidence might be taken. He showed that he had been in the
    habit of having commercial transactions with Cornish and was at that
    moment in his debt; that on the occasion in question Cornish had come
    to his house, but whether he came to speak with the Duke of Monmouth
    or not the witness could not say for certain; that he only remained a
    few minutes, and that no paper or declaration (on which so much stress
    had been laid) in connection with the conspiracy was read in Cornish’s
    presence; that in fact Cornish was not considered at the time as being
    in the plot. Such evidence, if not conclusive, ought to have gone far
    towards obtaining a verdict of acquittal for the prisoner. This was not
    the case, however. The jury, after a brief consultation, brought in a
    verdict of guilty, and Cornish had to submit to the indignity of being
    tied—like a dangerous criminal—whilst sentence of death was passed upon
    him and three others who had been tried at the same time.
  </p>

  <p>
    The prisoner was allowed but three clear days before he was hanged at
    the corner of King Street and Cheapside, within sight of the Guildhall,
    which he had so often frequented as an Alderman of the City, and on
    which his head was afterwards placed. He met his end with courage and
    with many pious expressions, but to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
    the last maintained his innocence
    with such vehemence that his enemies gave out that he had died in a fit
    of fury.”
  </p>

  <p>
    It is pleasing to add that four years later an Act of Parliament was
    passed reversing the attainder of Cornish. It is also pleasing to think
    that the blood of this innocent man, like the blood of the martyrs, was
    remembered by his fellow-citizens, that it strengthened the side of
    freedom and accelerated the fall of James.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the same day the people of London had a choice between two
    spectacles: that of Henry Cornish’s hanging, which was calculated to
    make every citizen thoughtful; or that of the burning of Elizabeth
    Gaunt at Tyburn—an act of brutal wickedness which ought to have made
    every citizen mad with indignation. Elizabeth Gaunt was a woman of
    great piety and charity; she visited the prisoners in the gaols; she
    relieved the sick; she fed the poor; she helped all who were afflicted,
    or in want, or in danger. Among others she helped a man named Burton,
    who was an outlaw, to escape. For this she was actually burned alive!
    The wretched man, Burton, turned King’s evidence and informed against
    his benefactress. One feels that it would be a moral lesson if we could
    ascertain the after-lives of Messrs. Rumsey, Goodenough, and Burton.
    The unfortunate gentlewoman behaved with fortitude, arranging with her
    own hands the straw around her so that she might the more quickly die.
    To us it seems incredible that judges should pass such sentences or
    should have such cases as those of Henry Cornish and Elizabeth Gaunt
    brought before them. As for the effect produced by these executions,
    they might, and no doubt did, terrify for a short time, but it was a
    terror which led to exasperation.
  </p>

  <p>
    We must remember that the temper of the City during the whole of the
    seventeenth century was profoundly hostile to the Catholics. The
    Gunpowder Plot; the Romish leanings of Laud; the Fire of London; the
    so-called Romanist plots; the Protestant literature of the period;
    the terrible stories of the Spanish Inquisition; everything conspired
    to keep alive the hatred and suspicion of the Catholic Church. And
    an event which happened in October 1685 taught the people, who were
    ripe for such a lesson, what was to be expected of a Roman Catholic
    Government.
  </p>

  <p>
    From time to time London has been enriched by the arrival of
    foreigners—Danes, Normans, Flemings, Italians, Palatines—who have
    brought with them new industries, and have settled down among the
    people, becoming English in the next generation. The most important
    of these immigrations was that of 1685, which came over here from
    France in consequence of the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, under
    which the Protestants of France had enjoyed the freedom of worshipping
    according to their own religion. A great many of them—probably about
    60,000—came to this country, bringing with them what money they had,
    amounting, as was estimated, to £3,000,000. Among them were artificers
    of various kinds, especially silk-weavers, gold and silversmiths,
    watchmakers and carvers.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span></p>

  <p>
    These refugees came over just before the death of Charles the Second;
    they were received with warm welcome; collections were made for them.
    There can be no doubt that the presence of these victims to Catholic
    bigotry largely stimulated the feeling against Catholicism which two
    or three years later ended in the expulsion of James. They were always
    in evidence. “See,” they said, “we are Protestants like yourselves;
    we have been driven from our own country for no other crime but our
    religion. What will happen to you when your King has had his own way
    and turned this country again to the Roman Catholic faith?” This was a
    question which was asked by everybody, and answered by every man and
    woman, however mean and illiterate, by one word.

      JAMES II. (1633–1701)
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    With all these facts before him, in the face of feeling so strong
    that it seems impossible that he could fail to understand it, James
    persisted in his purpose. Perhaps he relied on assurances of support
    from the Catholic gentry; perhaps he thought of using Irish troops;
    perhaps he even looked forward to assistance from Louis; perhaps he
    counted on Roman Catholic officers carrying with them the army. However
    this may be, James resolved that there should be no mistake about his
    intentions. The laws against the Catholics were disregarded. Roman
    Catholic chapels were openly built and the Romish services were openly
    performed in them; there were tumults in the City; the mob would have
    no wooden gods and tore down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
    the crucifix; they put up a cross and
    mocked it; they set upon the priests and ill-treated them; they would
    not believe that the Mayor really wished them to disperse. The trained
    bands actually refused to disperse the crowd while they were engaged on
    such pious work. Then James took a step which at first sight appears
    clever; it was really most unwise. He issued the famous Declaration of
    Indulgence which suspended all laws against Catholics and Dissenters
    alike. The Church of England, as he was going to find, was stronger
    than Roman Catholics and Dissenters put together. Indeed, many of the
    Dissenters very clearly understood that the Declaration was simply a
    measure of relief for the Catholics.
  </p>

  <p>
    James next took up his late brother’s plan, which was to gain over the
    Corporations in the country; six Commissioners were sent round to turn
    out all those persons who were in favour of the Test Act and the penal
    laws. The companies of London were treated in this way, with the result
    that some 900 persons were turned out of the Courts of Assistants. As
    for the City itself, which, it must be understood, was still deprived
    of its charter, Jeffreys was instructed to inform the Aldermen that
    in future their Court should recommend to the Crown persons fit to be
    Aldermen. Many of the Aldermen resigned rather than vote an address to
    the King for this liberty, which was in reality another link in the
    chain which kept the City in servitude. Recommending to the King is not
    exactly the same thing as free election. However, they did recommend
    and nominate persons to serve, but it was found extremely difficult to
    get any one to accept office. No less than £8500 were paid in fines by
    those who refused.
  </p>

  <p>
    In a very short time the City offices were nearly all held by
    Dissenters. A Dissenter was Lord Mayor, one Sir John Shorter, said to
    be an Anabaptist. The installation of Sir John was accompanied by a
    great dinner, to which every Alderman contributed £50; the King was
    present, with the Queen and the Papal Nuncio. The City Companies had
    turned out most of their Church of England members, and the Lord Mayor,
    Sir John Shorter, “a very odd, ignorant person, a mechanic, I think,
    and an Anabaptist” (Evelyn), openly attended a conventicle every Sunday.
  </p>

  <p>
    Among those who accepted office was William Kiffin. He was a leading
    Nonconformist in the City. Two of his grandsons, Benjamin and William
    Hewling, had been executed by Jeffreys for their share in the Monmouth
    rebellion. He was just seventy years of age, and had retired from
    active business when the King sent for him and made him accept office
    by telling him that if he refused he might be fined £20,000 or £30,000,
    or anything that the judges pleased. So the old man accepted. His
    account of the work entrusted to the Court of Aldermen is amazing. The
    King used to send them lists of liverymen who were to be turned out of
    their companies, with other lists of those to be put in. There were
    seven hundred so discharged without any charge or accusation, and all
    Protestants of the Church of England.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span></p>

  <p>
    The winter of 1687–88 passed quietly; but there were messengers
    secretly passing between London and Holland and the end was rapidly
    approaching. The King received addresses from all quarters thanking
    him for his Declaration of Indulgence; not only from Nonconformists
    about the country, but from the newly reformed City Companies, of
    whom, however, not all were found to join in the cry of gratitude.
    It would seem, however, as if the absence of any rebellion, coupled
    with the fact of their dutiful addresses, made James believe that he
    had a clear majority in support of his Declaration of Indulgence. He
    seems never to have understood the strength and the magnitude of the
    Established Church, just as he certainly never understood the strength
    and the extent of the popular hatred of his own Church. To the latter
    form of ignorance we may ascribe James’s acts and their consequences.
    He could not understand how the Catholic Church could be so deeply
    hated. Himself the son of a Catholic; his second wife a Catholic; his
    brother’s wife a Catholic; surrounded by Catholics in his own house,
    he was in no way able to comprehend why the country hated and feared
    his religion. In the same way the mediæval Jew could not understand
    that he was loathed and hated. Why should he be? He was a man, like
    the Christian, of similar body parts, and passions. He could never
    understand it. Now that loathing has become a thing of the past, he
    cannot yet understand it. So with James; he could not understand it.

  <p>
    In the spring, therefore, of 1688 James, still unable to understand,
    issued a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
    Second Declaration of Indulgence. Another interesting and
    dramatic spectacle was, in consequence of this mistake, provided by
    James for his loving subjects of London. This was the carriage of the
    Seven Bishops by water to the Tower. Their arrest was the King’s reply
    to their petition praying that the clergy might not be compelled to
    read the Second Declaration of Indulgence from the pulpit in the midst
    of public service. Only a few of the London clergy obeyed the order;
    one of them told the people that though he was ordered to read it, they
    were not ordered to hear it, and so waited till the Church was empty
    before he read it. In some churches the congregation, with one accord,
    rose and left the church as soon as the clergyman began to read the
    Declaration.

      PARLIAMENT IN THE REIGN OF JAMES II.
      <div class="subcap">E. Gardner’s Collection.</div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The objections of the Bishops are stated by Evelyn:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “Not that they were averse to the publishing of it for want of due
      tendernesse towards Dissenters, in relation to whom they should
      be willing to come to such a temper as should be thought fit,
      when that matter might be consider’d and settl’d in Parliament
      and Convocation; but that, the Declaration being founded on
      such a dispensing power as might at pleasure set aside all Laws
      Ecclesiastical and Civil, it appear’d to them illegal, as it had
      done to the Parliament in 1661 and 1672, and that it was a point of
      such consequence that they could not so far make themselves parties
      to it, as the reading of it in Church in time of divine service
      amounted to.”
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    The Bishops were sent to the Tower for refusing to give bail, “as it
    would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
    prejudiced their Peerage. The concern of the people,” says
    Evelyn, “was wonderful, infinite crowds on their knees begging their
    blessing and praying for them as they passed out of the barge along the
    Tower wharf.”
  </p>

  <p>
    That was on the 8th of June. On the 13th Evelyn visited four of the
    Bishops in the Tower. On the 15th they were brought to Westminster,
    where their indictment was read and they were called in to plead. They
    were called upon to give bail, but they refused; in the end they were
    dismissed on their own recognizances to appear that day fortnight.

  <p>
    On the 29th they appeared and the trial took place. It lasted from nine
    in the morning until six in the evening. At that hour the jury, who had
    been drawn from Middlesex, not from London, retired to consider their
    verdict. They could not at first agree, and were locked up all night.
    All were for acquittal except one. At last he, too, agreed with the
    others.
  </p>

  <p>
    “When this was heard,” says Evelyn, “there was great rejoicing: and
    there was a lane of people from the King’s Bench to the waterside on
    their knees, as the Bishops passed and repassed, to beg their blessing.
    Bonfires were made that night and bells rung, which was taken very ill
    at Court.”
  </p>

  <p>
    It is pleasing to note that the Bishops not only refused to give bail,
    but refused to pay any fees to the Lieutenant of the Tower.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was during their short imprisonment that the Prince of Wales, the
    Elder Pretender, was born, “which will cause disputes,” says Evelyn.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span></p>

  <p>
    Well assured of the spirit in which he would be received, the Prince of
    Orange made haste to prepare for his descent on England. In September
    the news came that a fleet of sixty sail was in readiness. Then James
    began to make concessions. The City should have its charter returned.
    This was done. But the City was no more inclined to Catholicism than
    before.
  </p>

  <p>The rest we know; William landed on the 5th of November.</p>

  <p>
    James sent for the Mayor and Aldermen, entrusted the care of the City
    to them, and instructed them, should he fall in battle, to proclaim
    the infant Prince of Wales successor to the Crown. He then set out for
    the west, to meet the invader. His army deserted him, and he returned
    to London, where there had been some riots and plundering of Roman
    Catholic chapels. A fortnight later, the Queen and her child having
    been got safely out of the country, James himself attempted to escape.
    As soon as this fact was known, many of the Lords, spiritual and
    temporal, met at the Guildhall and there drew up a declaration that
    they would stand by the Prince of Orange in maintaining the religion,
    the rights, and the liberties of the country. The declaration was
    communicated to the Court of Aldermen, who called a Court of Common
    Council, at which another address to the same effect was drawn up.
    James, as we know, failed in his first attempt to escape, being stopped
    by certain fisher folk at Feversham. Lord Winchilsea, for whom he sent,
    persuaded him to return to London. He was received, we are told, with
    the liveliest indications of joy, as if he had been the best Prince in
    the world. Perhaps the historian mistook rejoicings over the capture
    of a prisoner for those over the return of a well-beloved sovereign. A
    London mob may be fickle, but there was absolutely no reason for such a
    change of front as would justify a demonstration of joy. Rather must we
    believe that every shout which went up meant that the King was in the
    hands of his faithful subjects, and that the faithful subjects would be
    able to give him the same trial, with the same termination of it, which
    they gave to his father.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another of those dramatic scenes which enlivened the City during this
    reign was provided by the flight and capture of Judge Jeffreys.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Judge, who had presided over the butcheries in the west of England,
    who became the willing creature and tool of James in every illegal act,
    was regarded all over the country with a hatred exceeding that which
    any Englishman has achieved for a thousand years and more. No one knew
    this better than himself. When, therefore, the power of his master
    crumbled away he sought safety in flight.
  </p>

  <p>
    Why he did not escape to France; whether his nerve failed him; whether
    there was no time; whether there was no one he could trust, one knows
    not. It is, however, certain that he was suffering from a cruel
    disease, which caused him the greatest agonies and was partly the
    cause of that roaring voice, those bullying tones, which made him the
    terror of the Court and aggravated the agonies of punishment. I think
    it not impossible that a severe attack of this disease prevented him
    from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
    moving till it was too late; he then assumed the disguise of a
    sailor and took refuge in a humble tavern at Wapping. Here, however, he
    was recognised as he looked out of a window, and was dragged out and
    committed to prison, having been so roughly handled by the mob that
    he died of the injuries he received. According to another account,
    however, he drank to excess, and so killed himself. As for the King, he
    was permitted to escape, the Prince of Orange doubtless feeling that
    though he did not hesitate about taking his father-in-law’s place, he
    did not desire his head.

  <p>
    And so James vanished from the scene and a new king reigned. But
    neither in the reign of William nor in that of any following sovereign
    were there so many splendid sights and anxious moments as in that of
    the unfortunate king whom we have learned to despise more profoundly
    than any other sovereign who ever sat upon the sacred Coronation chair.
  </p>

  <p>
    The events connecting London with the reign of James II. belong for
    the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
    part to the history of the country. I have not thought it
    necessary, therefore, to dwell at length upon them.
  </p>

  <p>
    The following, on the condition of London after the abdication, is an
    extract from the <cite>English Courant and London Mercury</cite>. It is quoted by
    Malcolm (<cite>Manners and Customs</cite>, 1811):—
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “No sooner was the King’s withdrawing known, but the mobile
      consulted to wreak their vengeance on papists and popery: and
      last night began with pulling down and burning the new-built
      Mass-house near the arch, in Lincolns Inn Fields: thence they went
      to Wild-house, the residence of the Spanish Ambassador, where they
      ransackt, destroy’d and burnt all the ornamental and inside part
      of the chappel, some cartloads of choice books, manuscript, etc.
      And not content here, some villanous thieves and common rogues,
      no doubt, that took this opportunity to mix with the youth, and
      they plunder’d the Ambassador’s house of plate, jewels, mony,
      rich goods, etc.: and also many other who had sent in there for
      shelter their money, plate, etc.: among which, one gentlewoman
      lost a trunk, in which was £800 in mony, and a great quantity of
      plate. Thence they went to the Mass-house, at St. James’s, near
      Smithfield, demolisht it quite; from thence to Blackfryers near the
      Ditchside, where they destroy’d Mr. Henry Hill’s printing-house,
      spoil’d his forms, letters, etc., and burnt 2 or 300 reams
      of paper, printed and unprinted: thence to the Mass-house in
      Bucklersbury and Lime-street, and there demolisht and burnt as
      before: and this night they went to the Nuncio’s, and other places
      at that end of the town; but finding the birds flown, and the
      bills on the door, they drew off: thence they went into the City,
      threatening to pull down all papists’ houses, particularly one in
      Ivy Lane, and the market house upon Newgate Market, for no other
      reason but that one Burdet, a papist, was one of the farmers of
      the market; but by the prudence of the citizens and some of their
      trained bands, they were got off without mischief doing anywhere.
    </p>

    <p>
      Tuesday night last, and all Wednesday, the apprentices were busy in
      pulling down the chappels, and spoiling the houses of papists: they
      crying out the fire should not go out till the Prince of Orange
      came to town. There were thousands of them on Wednesday at the
      Spanish Ambassador’s, they not leaving any wainscot withinside the
      house or chappel, taking away great quantities of plate, with much
      money, household goods and writings, verifying the old proverb ‘All
      fish that came to the net.’ The spoil of the house was very great,
      divers papists having sent their goods in thither, as judging that
      the securest place.
    </p>

    <p>
      Then they went to the Lord Powis’s great house in Lincoln’s Inn
      Fields, wherein was a guard, and a bill upon the door, ‘This house
      is appointed for the Lord Delameer’s quarters:’ and some of the
      company crying, ‘Let it alone, the Lord Powis was against the
      Bishops going to the Tower,’ they offered no violence to it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Afterwards they marched down the Strand with oranges upon their
      sticks, crying for the Prince of Orange, and went to the Pope’s
      Nuncio’s, but finding a bill upon the door, ‘This house is to be
      let,’ they desisted. Lastly, they did some damage to the house of
      the resident of the Duke of Tuscany, in the Haymarket, carrying
      away some of his goods, when one Captain Douglas, coming thither
      with a company of trained bands to suppress them, a soldier,
      unadvisedly firing at the boys with ball, shot the Captain through
      the back, of which he lyes languishing. They also went to the
      houses of the French and other Ambassadors, but finding them
      deserted and the landlords giving them money, they marched off.
    </p>

    <p>
      On Thursday, an order of the Lords coming forth, warning all
      persons to desist from pulling down any house, especially those of
      the Ambassadors, upon penalty of the utmost severity of the law to
      be inflicted on them: since which they have been very quiet.”

      <span class="subhead">WILLIAM THE THIRD</span>
    </h3>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">
    <span class="smcap">At</span> the Coronation Banquet the Lord Mayor, the Aldermen, and the members
    of the twelve principal companies attended as butler and assistants.
    The City plate was also lent for the occasion. This was on the 11th of
    April 1689. Since the Prince of Orange had entered London on December
    18, 1688, when James fled, the country had been left without King or
    Government. The “Convocation,” as it was called, met on January 22.
    On the 28th the Commons declared the throne to be vacant, and on the
    6th of February the House of Lords passed a similar resolution. A
    Declaration of Rights was next drawn up condemning the unconstitutional
    acts of James and offering the throne to William and Mary. After their
    proclamation their Majesties made haste to convert the Convocation into
    Parliament.
  </p>

  <p>
    The reign of William presents few surprises or dramatic scenes so far
    as the City of London is concerned. On the other hand, there was a
    great deal done towards the strengthening and definition of the City
    rights and liberties. The Stuart kings, who could learn nothing and
    forget nothing, were gone, never to return; in future it would be
    quite as impossible for the sovereign to rob London of her liberties
    as to reign without a Parliament. Out of the arbitrary acts of the two
    Charleses, the elder and the younger, out of the civil wars, out of the
    expulsion of James, came to London the secure possession, henceforth
    unquestioned, of her charters, just as to the three kingdoms came
    constitutional government and a sovereign bound by the will of the
    people. These were great gains; one who could realise the state of
    the country even under the well-beloved despot Elizabeth, and compare
    it with its condition under the Georges, might well acknowledge that
    the gain was worth all the fighting and struggle, all the trials and
    executions which had to be endured in achieving it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Of the loyalty of the City throughout this reign there can be no
    question. The address drawn up by the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs soon
    after it began on the occasion of a discovery of a plot against the
    King strikes a note which was maintained throughout:—
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span></p>

  <p>
    “And we most humbly beg leave to assure your Majesty that we will, as
    far as our Power extends, oppose ourselves to, and suppress all designs
    of that Nature; and will search after, disarm, seize, secure, and bring
    to Justice all Persons concerned therein, or contributing thereto: And
    we are unanimously, firmly, and unalterably resolved and determined to
    stand by, defend, and maintain your Majesty, and your Government, with
    the uttermost Hazard and Expence of our Lives and Estates, against all
    Persons whatsoever, that shall conspire or attempt any Thing against
    the same” (<cite>Maitland</cite>, i. p. 491).
  </p>

  <p>
    The pageant on Lord Mayor’s Day was attended by the King and Queen,
    who sat in the usual place reserved for them in Cheapside—the balcony
    of St. Mary le Bow. After the pageant they dined with the Lord Mayor
    at Guildhall. The pageant itself may be found briefly described in
    Fairholt’s <cite>Book of Pageants</cite>. It will be seen by those who look up the
    passage that we are indeed far from the pageants of Edward the Third or
    Henry the Fifth.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was natural that the first desire of the City should be to obtain
    an Act of Parliament declaring the forfeiture of their charter to be
    illegal. On March 8, 1689, the Grand Committee of Grievances reported
    that the rights of the City of London in the election of Sheriffs were
    invaded in the year 1682, and that the judgment given upon the <i xml:lang="la">Quo
    Warranto</i> was illegal. The Act of Parliament by which the charters of
    the City were formally declared is a lengthy document of very great
    importance. An abridgment of this Act follows:—
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “Whereas a Judgment was given in the Court of King’s-Bench, in or
      about <i>Trinity-Term</i>, in the thirty-fifth Year of the Reign of the
      late King Charles the Second, upon an Information, in the Nature of
      a <i xml:lang="la">Quo Warranto</i>, exhibited in the said Court against the Mayor and
      Commonalty and Citizens of the City of London, That the liberty,
      Privilege, and Franchise of the said Mayor, and Commonalty, and
      Citizens, being a Body Politick and Corporate, should be seized
      into the King’s hands as forfeited; And forasmuch as the said
      Judgment, and the proceedings thereupon, is and were illegal
      and arbitrary; and for that the restoring of the said Mayor and
      Commonalty and Citizens to their antient Liberties, of which they
      had been deprived, tends very much to the Peace and good Settlement
      of this Kingdom.
    </p>

    <p>
      2. Be it declared and enacted, ... That the said Judgment given
      in the said Court of King’s Bench in the said Trinity Term, in
      the thirty-fifth year of the reign of the said King Charles the
      Second, or in any other Term; and all or every other Judgment for
      the seizing into the late King’s Hands the Liberty, Privilege, or
      Franchise of the Mayor, and Commonalty, and Citizens of the City of
      London, is, shall be, and are hereby reversed, annulled, and made
      void, to all Intents and Purposes whatsoever; and that Vacates be
      entered upon the Rolls of the said Judgment, for the Vacating and
      Reversal of the same accordingly.
    </p>

    <p>
      3. And be it further declared and enacted, by the Authority
      aforesaid, That the Mayor and Commonalty, and Citizens of the City
      of London, shall and may for ever hereafter remain, continue,
      and be, and prescribe to be a Body Corporate and Politick, in
      <i xml:lang="la">re, facto and nomine</i>, by the Name of Mayor and Commonalty, and
      Citizens of the City of London, and by that Name, and all and every
      other Name and Names of Incorporation, by which they at any Time
      before the said Judgment were incorporated, to sue, plead, and be
      impleaded, and to answer and be answered, etc.”
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    At the same time the City proceeded to lay down and define the rights
    of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
    the inhabitants in voting for Aldermen and Common Council men. The
    following is the Act of Common Council:—
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “It is hereby declared, That it is, and antiently hath been the
      Right and Privilege of the Freemen of the said City only, being
      Householders, paying Scot and bearing Lot, and of none other
      whatsoever, in their several and respective Wards, from Time to
      Time, as often as there was or should be occasion, to nominate
      Aldermen, and elect Common Council men for the same respective
      Wards. That all and every the Beadle and Beadles of the respective
      Wards shall do, prepare, return, and deliver to the Aldermen at
      their several and respective Courts of Wardmote, or to their
      Deputies authorized to hold the same, one List of all and every
      the Freeman Householders aforesaid, dwelling and residing within
      the respective Wards, to which they are Beadles, and of no others,
      apart and by themselves: And also one list of all and every other
      Householders within the said respective Wards only, apart and by
      themselves: To the intent that such Freemen Householders, may
      nominate Aldermen, and elect their Common Councilmen: And they,
      together with the other Householders, may chuse their Constables,
      Scavengers, Inquest and Beadles.”
    </p>

  <p>
    So that those who were not Freemen of the City had no right to vote at
    all. This limitation of the vote was confirmed in 1711, 1712, in 1714,
    and by an Act of Parliament of 11 George I.
  </p>

  <p>
    There were scares in the City, first after the defeat of the Dutch
    fleet on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
    June 30, 1691, by the French, when the latter were expected
    to attempt a landing up the Thames; and next when a report was raised
    that King James was at the head of a powerful French army. On both
    occasions the City put on a bold front, called out and equipped 10,000
    men, and invited the Queen to appoint officers. It will be remembered
    that on the scare of the Spanish Armada, doubts were cast on the
    efficiency of the London contingent because the men would only obey
    their own officers, who were notoriously incompetent. Here we see a
    change. The City now recognises the fact that an officer cannot be made
    out of a merchant in a single day.

  <p>
    The City next had to go before Parliament in the humiliating position
    of a trustee who has lost trust money. The case was this. It had long
    been the custom of the City to take care of orphans, being children of
    Freemen, their fortunes or portions being received by the Chamber and
    administered for them. The Mayor now declared that this money had so
    grievously diminished that they simply could not pay the orphans on
    coming of age their own estates. Several reasons were alleged for this
    loss: the stoppage of the Exchequer, Charles’s act of robbery; a large
    part of the fund had been lent to the Exchequer; other sums had been
    lost in various ways, and the City now found itself in debt to orphans
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
    for £500,000, and £247,500 in other ways, the whole being far more than
    it could pay. A committee was appointed to investigate the case, and on
    their report an Act was passed, of which the following are the heads:—
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “That towards settling a perpetual Fund for paying the yearly
      Interest of four Pounds, for every hundred Pound due by the City to
      their Creditors, all the Manors, Messuages, Lands, Markets, Fairs,
      and other Hereditaments, Revenues and Income whatsoever, belonging
      to the Mayor, Commonalty, and Citizens, in Possession or Reversion,
      and all Improvements that shall be made thereof (excepting the
      Estates and Possessions belonging to Christ’s, St. Bartholomew’s,
      St. Thomas’s, Bridewell, Bethlehem, or any other of the City
      Hospitals, and the Estates appropriated for the repair of London
      Bridge), are for ever charged, from the twenty-fourth of June in
      the present Year, for raising annually the sum of eight thousand
      Pounds, clear of all Deductions.
    </p>

    <p>
      2. That all the Profits arising from the several Aqueducts
      belonging to the City be applied towards the Payment of the said
      Interest.
    </p>

    <p>
      3. Towards the Support of the said Fund, the Lord Mayor and Common
      Council are impowered annually to raise the Sum of two Thousand
      Pounds, by an equal Assessment upon the personal Estates of the
      Citizens.
    </p>

    <p>
      4. Towards the Support of the said Fund, be paid the annual Sum
      of six hundred Pounds, being the Fine or Rent paid by certain
      Persons for the Privilege of illuminating the Streets of the City
      with Convex Lamps. This tended very much to the Dishonour of the
      City, to make a pecuniary advantage of a publick Benefit; but the
      same being removed, to the no small honour of the Gentlemen in the
      present Direction of the City Affairs, I shall say no more on that
      Head.
    </p>

    <p>
      5. That every Apprentice, at the Time of his being bound, shall pay
      towards the said Fund two shillings and six Pence.
    </p>

    <p>
      6. That every Person, upon his being admitted a Freeman of the
      City, shall pay towards the Support of the said Fund five Shillings.
    </p>

    <p>
      7. That every Ton of Wine imported into the Port of London, shall
      pay towards the support of the said Fund five Shillings.
    </p>

    <p>
      8. That, towards the increase of the said Fund, all Coals imported
      into the Port of London shall pay four Pence the Chaldron Metage
      above what was formerly paid.
    </p>

    <p>
      9. And, as a further Increase to the said Fund, all Coals imported
      into the Port of London after the twenty-ninth of September,
      Anno 1770, the Measurable to pay six Pence the Chaldron, and the
      Weighable six Pence the Ton, for the term of Fifty Years. And to
      the Intent that the said Fund may be perpetual, it is enacted,
      That, after the Expiration of the said Term of fifty Years, when
      the said six Pence per Cauldron and Ton upon Coals shall cease,
      then all the Manors, Messuages, Lands, Tenements, Markets, Fairs,
      and the Duties thereof, and other Hereditaments, Revenues and
      Income whatsoever, belonging to the City either in Possession or
      Reversion, shall stand charged with the yearly Sum of six thousand
      Pounds, over and above the already named Sum of eight Thousand
      Pounds per Ann.”
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Dissensions over elections and the mode of elections, scares about
    plots and the rumours of plots, rejoicings over victory, make up the
    history of London during the next few years. The losses of the Turkey
    merchants when, for want of a sufficient convoy, their ships were taken
    or burned by the French, were a national disaster. The merchant fleet
    was valued at many millions; the convoy forwarded the merchantmen
    safely as far as the Land’s End, when it left them to a smaller convoy
    of seventeen ships under Rooke. They found their way barred by the
    French fleet; in the fight that followed some of the merchantmen
    escaped, but the greater number were lost. “Never within the memory of
    man,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
    Macaulay says, “had there been in the City a day of more gloom
    and agitation than that on which the news of the encounter arrived.
    Money-lenders, an eye-witness said, went away from the Exchange as pale
    as if they had received sentence of death.” The Queen expressed her
    sorrow and sympathy and promised an inquiry. The probable cause of the
    desertion of the merchantmen by the main convoy was that it was not
    safe to leave the Channel unguarded so long.

    Everybody who studies London possesses among his collection pictures of
    the street cries. These drawings generally belong to the later years
    of the eighteenth century or the beginning of the nineteenth. They
    establish the fact that the streets were filled with a never-ending
    procession of men and women with baskets, carts, wheel-barrows, trays,
    boxes, all bawling their wares at the top of the voice. You may look
    into the shop now called an “Oilman’s”; nearly all the things he sells
    were formerly vended in the street. The conversion of the wheel-barrow
    and the tray into the shop would prove a chapter in the history of
    London trade.

    It is therefore interesting to learn that these hawkers and pedlars had
    already, at the end of the seventeenth century, increased so greatly
    as to become a nuisance to the Citizens. The Common Council proceeded
    against them with an Act providing that
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “No Person should presume to sell any Goods, or Merchandize,
      in any Street, Lane, Passage, Tavern, Inn, Ale-house, or other
      Publick Place within the City or Liberties thereof, other than in
      open Markets and Fairs, upon the Penalty of forty Shillings for
      every such Offence. And, for the more effectual Preventing such
      Practices, all Citizens buying Goods of such Persons to forfeit the
      like Sum of forty Shillings for every such Offence. And, as farther
      Discouragement to all Hawkers and Pedlars, every Citizen that
      should permit or suffer such Persons to expose to Sale any Goods
      or Merchandize in his, her, or their Houses, should for every such
      Offence likewise forfeit the Sum of forty Shillings” (<cite>Maitland</cite>,
      i. p. 479).
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    At the same time an Act of Parliament imposed a tax upon them. The
    hawker or pedlar played an important part in the country life from an
    early period. He it was who circulated among the villages, and from
    farm to farm, the things for which in the country there existed no
    shops. Autolycus belongs to all ages, and in all ages he is a jovial,
    sharp, ready-witted rascal who will pass off his damaged goods for
    new, will buy cheap and sell dear. The hawkers escaped legislation
    in mediæval England, and are first noticed in a statute of Edward
    VI., in which “they are treated in a very contemptuous manner, being
    described as more ‘hurtful than necessary to the commonwealth.’ But
    the case of pedlars was not seriously taken in hand before the reign
    of William III., who put a tax upon them and, ominously enough, bound
    them to certify commissioners for transportation how they travelled and
    traded.”
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span></p>

  <p>We have seen how the Franciscans became pedlars,</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">“Thai dele with purses, pynnes and knyves,</div>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    The hawker of London was not exactly the same as the hawker of the
    country. In the first place, it is evident that the City disliked his
    setting up a stall outside the markets or the streets where special
    things were sold; the companies still exercised the power of regulating
    trade; there was still the old jealousy which would not allow one
    trader to sell things belonging to another company. But the object of
    hawkers was to sell everything wanted for the daily life; like the
    Franciscan, he would not only sell mercery but also cutlery. This
    kind of hawker was effectually banished from the City, even though
    shopkeepers had now begun to mix up various companies and crafts in the
    same counter. The London hawker was reduced to selling one thing, and
    one thing only. In all the pictures of the street cries we find the
    hawker engaged in crying one thing for sale; he offered to catch rats,
    or sold sand, small coal, boot laces, door-mats, baskets, sausages, and
    so on, whatever was wanted for everyday use and could not be found in
    the shops.

    The hawkers of 1695, since they could not set up stalls or sell in
    the streets, tried to force an entrance into the markets. Upon which
    the Council laid down the law that the markets were not to be used as
    a place of sale for goods sold in the shops or warehouses of Freemen
    of the City. This important Act, which continued in force until the
    nineteenth century, should be quoted:—
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “Whereas by the Laws, Customs, and antient Usages of the City of
      London, confirmed by Parliament, every shop and warehouse within
      the said City, and Liberties of the same, having open shew into any

      accustomed to be, and in very deed is an open and Publick Market
      Place for Persons free of the said City, for every Day of the Week,
      except Sundays, for Shew and Sale of Wares and Merchandizes, within
      the said City and Liberties thereof:

    <p>
      And whereas all other publick Markets within this City, and the
      Liberties of the same, that is to say, Leadenhall-Market, the
      Green-Yard or Herb-Market, Stocks-Market, Honey-Lane-Market,
      Newgate-Market, and all other such like Markets, were and are
      appointed and ordained, by the Laws and Constitutions of this City,
      to be held and used upon particular and certain Days only in the
      Week, and on certain Hours of such Days, as open Markets for all
      Foreigners and Freemen and Women to use and resort unto for Sale
      of Flesh, Fish, Butter, Cheese, Eggs, Fruit, Herbs, Roots, and
      such like Victuals and Food, for the Support and Sustenance of
      the Citizens and other Inhabitants of the said City and Liberties
      of the same; and were not appointed for any other Use or Purpose
      whatsoever, save for the Sale of Raw Hides, Tanned Leather, Tallow
      and Wool, as appears by the Laws and Orders of the Court of
      Aldermen and Common Council, for regulating the same:
    </p>

    <p>
      But nevertheless, for Want of due Encouragement, in the Execution
      thereof, several Hawkers, Pedlars, and Petty Chapmen and others,
      contrary to the said Constitution and proper Use and Intention
      of the said Markets, do now come to the said Markets, and there
      sell and expose to Sale Mercery Wares, Lace, Linen, Grocery Wares,
      Confectionery Wares, Drapery Wares, Millinery Wares, Glass and

      City, and Liberties thereof, upon Pain to forfeit and pay for
      every such Offence (by him, her, or them committed or done to the
      contrary), the Sum of three Pounds of lawful Money of England, to
      be sued for and recovered, with reasonable Costs of Suit, by Action
      or Actions of Debt, to be brought and prosecuted within fourteen
      Days after such Offence or Offences shall be committed, in the name
      of the Chamberlain of this City for the Time being, in the open

    In 1695 we hear of the first indications that the Jacobite party was
    still strong in the City as elsewhere. It was on the 10th of June, the
    birthday of the Prince of Wales, that a number of Jacobites assembled
    in a tavern of Drury Lane, where they proceeded to drink the health of
    the Prince. Thence they went out into the streets with drums and flags
    and insisted upon everybody’s drinking the same toast. It was a time
    when the people could not wait for the interference of the police,
    because there were none; they were obliged to act for themselves,
    and often acted in a more efficient manner than any police. On this
    occasion they poured out into the streets, armed, and with one consent
    set upon the Jacobites, put them to flight, took one prisoner, and
    sacked the tavern. In the same year we read of another Jacobite
    ebullition when, the King being abroad carrying on the war with France,
    a man rode through the streets crying aloud that King William was
    dead: an adventure which might have done great mischief. The King,
    who was not dead after all, returned in October. Then occurred the
    assassination plot. He was to be murdered after hunting in Richmond
    Park. Fortunately the plot was discovered and the ringleaders arrested.
    The trained bands were called out and an address of loyalty was drawn
    up by the Corporation.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 1697 the King returned to London on the Treaty of Ryswick. He
    consented to make a public entry. It was made the occasion of a
    procession of great magnificence, though falling very far short of the
    old pageants.

    A long succession of cold and rainy seasons caused many bad harvests,
    in so much that for some years there was a great dearth of corn, wheat
    being sold at as high as three pounds eight shillings a quarter.
    Considering the value of money then—it was almost twice as much as at
    present—we may understand the cost of wheat bread. But the working
    classes did never eat wheat bread except as a luxury. They lived on
    oaten bread.

    In the year 1699 occurred another scare about the wicked Papists. The
    Mayor and Aldermen were summoned before the Privy Council, when the
    King informed them that he had heard of a great increase of Papists
    in the City; that they openly attended Mass-houses in spite of the
    law; that he had commanded all Jesuits and Popish priests to leave
    the country; that he had recalled all those English students who were
    educated abroad, and that he looked to the Lord Mayor for vigilance
    in searching out Papists, especially those who had arms concealed,
    destroying Papistical books, shutting up Mass-houses and Catholic
    schools, and administering the oaths to suspected Papists.

    On Friday, November 26, 1703, the greatest hurricane of wind and
    rain ever known in this country “o’er pale Britannia passed.” This
    really belongs chronologically<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
    to the eighteenth century, and has
    been described in that volume, but some reference to it here is also
    necessary. It began about seven o’clock in the evening, and raged all
    night long. It overturned houses, uprooted trees, blew down stacks
    of chimneys, rolled up the lead on the roofs of churches, overthrew
    walls, and tore off tiles, which it blew about like snowflakes. The
    streets were covered with brickbats, broken signs, tiles, bulks, and
    pent-houses; the houses in the City at daybreak looked like skeletons,
    being stripped of their roofs, with their windows blown in or out;
    the people destroyed were said, and believed, to number thousands;
    all business was suspended while the houses were made once more
    weather-proof; the price of tiles rose from a guinea to six pounds a
    thousand; at sea twelve men-of-war were destroyed with 1800 men on
    board, and the whole of the shipping in the Pool except four vessels
    were driven from their moorings to beat against each other and to
    founder off Limehouse.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Common Council in 1704 considered the condition of the night watch.
    They ordered that 583 men, strong and able-bodied, should watch all
    night, divided among the respective wards. When we read that for the
    small precinct of Blackfriars alone six men were ordered to patrol
    the streets all night, that for Monkwell Street alone two men were to
    walk up and down all night, one wonders at the stories of midnight
    violence, burglary, and robbery belonging to the eighteenth century.
    What were those able-bodied men doing? It is another illustration of
    the difference between a strong law and a strong executive.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Union of England and Scotland being at last happily accomplished,
    the Queen was carried to St. Paul’s in a solemn procession for a
    Thanksgiving service.

    In 1709 arrived in London a body of helpless and destitute people from
    the Palatinate, which had been devastated by the French; there were
    nearly 12,000 of them. At first they were maintained by charity, over
    £22,000 being subscribed for their immediate necessities. They were
    then settled in various places; about 3000 were sent to Ireland, to
    each of the provinces of North and South Carolina about 600, and to
    the Province of New York about 3500. This settlement was made by a
    Committee appointed by the Queen. It consisted of the Great Officers
    of State, many of the nobility, the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of the
    City and other persons of distinction, in number 121. These Trustees,
    as they were called, met every afternoon in the week at four o’clock,
    either at Whitehall or at the Guildhall Council Chamber. There were not
    wanting malcontents who thought that the country had paupers enough of
    its own without importing others. The example of the Huguenots, whose
    reception in this country brought new industries and increased wealth,
    might have taught a lesson, but it did not. Perhaps the double example
    of the welcome given to the Huguenots first and the Palatinates next
    may serve for another lesson at the present moment when the immigration
    of Polish and Russian Jews by the thousand terrifies some of us.

  <p>
    During the whole of this reign, and in that of its successor, party
    feeling ran high with High Churchmen and Moderates, including
    Dissenters.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the autumn of the year 1709 two sermons were preached, by one
    Henry Sacheverell, D.D., which produced consequences not often due
    to the pulpit. The preacher himself has been represented by those of
    the opposite side as an obscure divine, of bad moral character, of no
    learning, of no eloquence, and of boundless impudence. This description
    of the famous Doctor must be taken with a very large deduction for the
    personal equation. Henry Sacheverell was the son of a clergyman, Rector
    of Marlborough, Wilts, and the grandson of a strong Presbyterian. He
    was entered at Magdalen College, Oxford, where he had Addison for his
    fellow-student and his friend. Certain Latin verses of his are inserted
    in the <cite>Musæ Anglicanæ</cite>, and certain English verses of his may be found
    in Nichol’s Collection. He was born in 1672, was Master of Arts in
    1696, and Doctor of Divinity in 1708. He lectured or took pupils at
    Oxford for a few years, and then became successively vicar of a country
    parish and Chaplain of St. Saviour’s, Southwark. In August 1709 he
    delivered a sermon at the Derby Assizes, in which he maintained the
    doctrine, which many Oxford men then held, of passive obedience. To us
    the doctrine appears too ridiculous to need refutation; to the Tories
    and High Churchmen of that time it was a very serious position indeed,
    and one which was maintained by the support of Scripture. On November
    the 5th of the same year he was invited to preach before the Mayor
    and Corporation at St. Paul’s Cathedral. His sermon on this day was
    to the same effect. He took for his text the words “Perils from false
    brethren.” He asserted in the strongest terms the doctrines of passive
    obedience and non-resistance; he spoke of the Revolution as a crime
    never to be forgiven, and he called the Bishops perfidious prelates and
    false sons of the Church because they approved of toleration. It was
    customary for the Mayor to command the printing of any sermon preached
    before the Corporation. But in this case the Mayor did not make the
    usual order, the reason being that many of the Aldermen and Common
    Council were alarmed at the extreme views advanced.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let us understand that if this man had been the impudent, arrogant,
    self-seeking quack which some histories represent him, it is quite
    unlikely that the Mayor would have invited him to preach. Vain, carried
    away by his sudden popularity, he may have been, but he was eloquent,
    he was scholarly, and he undoubtedly possessed the power of moving his
    audience. Other divines on the High Church side had raged against the
    Revolution but to no purpose; there is talk of a certain Higgins who is
    said to have made loud outcries against the condition of the Church and
    the general wickedness. Yet no one heeded Higgins. But Sacheverell they
    did heed.
  </p>

  <p>
    His sermons, both that of Derby and that of St. Paul’s, were published.
    The Tories ran after them eagerly, cried them up, ordered everybody
    to buy them, with the result that 40,000 copies were sold throughout
    the kingdom. The number, to us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
    who are accustomed to see popular
    papers sold by millions, does not seem large, but think what it really
    meant at that time; it meant about two copies for every parish in the
    kingdom. In the town parishes the pamphlet was handed about from one to
    the other. Forty thousand copies of a sermon represent ten times that
    number of readers; it means the whole nation moved and agitated. All
    who could read did read these sermons; all who could not listened to
    the discussions on them.
  </p>

  <p>
    They were considered by the Council. All were of the opinion that
    the preacher ought to be prosecuted; there were differences as to
    the method and as to the court by which he should be tried. It was
    finally resolved that he should be impeached before the two Houses of
    Parliament.
  </p>

  <p>
    There were delays before the impeachment could be carried out. Meantime
    the High Church party and the clergy in general were actively engaged
    in proclaiming that the Church was in danger, and in inflaming the
    minds of the people against the Dissenters. And then occurred one of
    those strange tumults in which the lowest classes in London have risen
    up, from time to time, in favour of religion and morality, as if they
    understood in the least what these words mean. The ’prentices waging
    war against disorderly houses, the craftsmen destroying the Savoy in
    defence of their Bishop, the mob tearing down Mass-houses, the mob
    throwing up their hats for Sacheverell, the mob following Lord George
    Gordon—all these are risings of the same kind. Other reasons are
    assigned in each case; the one and only reason, apart from the general
    love of a fight, which lies always in the heart of the Londoner, was a
    blind desire for truth and justice. Who were the Dissenters? They were
    Puritans; they were the people, who, when they had the power, forbade
    the old sports, and persecuted those who would still play them; they
    were the masters who commanded the way of their people in matters of
    religion as in matters of politics; they had turned merry London into
    morose London. It is generally believed that the common people did not
    go to church, and therefore had no love for the church. This is most
    untrue. The City was still full of the craftsmen; all those who lived
    in the City went to church. How many of those who lived outside the
    walls, what proportion of those who were settled beyond the walls,
    went to church one has no means of ascertaining. But within the walls
    all the people went to church. So that when we hear that ’prentices,
    butchers, chimney-sweepers, scavengers, fellowship porters, and the
    like made up the mob which bawled in the streets the cry of “The Church
    in danger,” we need only remark that respectable people never join a
    mob and never bawl in the streets for any cause whatsoever. In a word,
    there is every reason to believe the mob to have been filled with
    an honest conviction that this cause was that of religion, pure and
    undefiled.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the 27th day of February, Dr. Sacheverell was brought to the bar
    before the Lords and Commons in Westminster Hall. Immense importance
    was attached to the case; the Queen was present, but privately. Seats
    were arranged for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
    Commons and for the noble ladies who were here
    in crowds; galleries were set up at the end of the hall for the people,
    and a raised platform for the managers of the impeachment and for the
    defendant. We need not follow the course of the trial. On the 23rd day
    of March, more than three weeks after it began, the case ended. The
    Doctor was ordered to abstain from preaching for three years. Meantime
    the mob had been showing the sincerity of its conviction not only by
    cheering the defendant every day as he went to the Hall or returned,
    but by wrecking the Dissenting chapels. They broke into the Gate Street
    Chapel, took out everything—pulpit, pews, Bibles, cushions, sconces—and
    carried the whole into Lincoln’s Inn Fields, where they made a bonfire
    of the things, shouting “High Church and Sacheverell!” In Blackfriars,
    Clerkenwell, Long Acre, Shoe Lane, and Leather Lane they also wrecked
    the chapels. The rioters were dispersed by a detachment of Guards
    without any bloodshed.

      HENRY SACHEVERELL, D.D. (1674?–1724)

  <p>
    The sentence passed upon the Doctor was considered as an acquittal.
    Bonfires illuminated the City in the evening; drink flowed; every one
    was made to drink the health of the Doctor. The subsequent career of
    Sacheverell was tame. He made a kind of triumphal progress through
    the country, though some of the towns refused to admit him. Oxford
    received him as if he was a martyr, or a confessor at least.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span> Finally,
    he settled down at St. Andrew’s, Holborn, where he died at the age
    of fifty. Such a man must needs make many enemies. Among them was
    the Duchess of Marlborough. She calls him “a lewd, drunken, pampered
    man,” and says that “he had not learning enough to speak or write true
    English, but a heap of bombast, ill-connected words at command.” He
    had a “haughty and insolent air” which helped him with the public. She
    acknowledges, however, that he had “a good assurance, clean gloves,
    white handkerchief, well managed, with other suitable accomplishments,
    which moved the hearts of many at his appearance.” She says that his
    speech in defence was written for him; that many of the “weaker” ladies
    were more like mad or bewitched than like persons in their senses.
    It might seem to us, who live so very far from passive obedience and
    non-resistance, as if the occasion were enormously exaggerated. That,
    however, was certainly not the case. The clergy were only too ready,
    one and all, to join in the prosecution of the Nonconformists, in the
    suppression of free thought, and in the corresponding doctrines of
    non-resistance. It was most certainly desirable, above all things, if
    the Protestant succession were to be secured, that these doctrines
    should be placed before the people in their true light; whatever the
    mob might bawl, whatever ecclesiastics might preach, the men of sense
    and understanding must not only go on their way, but must show the
    world the reason of their action. By the impeachment of a greatly
    overrated preacher before both Houses of Parliament the Government
    committed both Houses to the maintenance of religious toleration,
    to the Protestant succession, and to the liberties of the country.
    Considered from that point of view the case of this person must be
    regarded as the most important State trial. The Doctor is reproached
    with having his head turned by the honours bestowed upon him. We may
    forgive him. Who would not have his head turned, first, by the enormous
    success of a sermon; next, by being thought worthy of a State trial
    in Westminster Hall; lastly, by receiving every evidence of popular
    approval that a shouting, bawling mob can give, to say nothing of the
    gifts, the letters, the assurances of great ladies and noble lords? Of
    course his head was turned.
  </p>

  <p>
    When the Sacheverell tumults were finished and over, the Lord Mayor
    issued an order for the suppression of such assemblies of rude and
    disorderly persons by the constables. We have already noted the
    appearance of these documents and proclamations and their futile
    character, because without sufficient force of police in reserve such
    general orders are powerless.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Statute for the erection of fifty new churches in the suburbs
    of London indicates the growth of the City outside the walls. Fifty
    churches would provide accommodation for fifty thousand people; or,
    allowing for the infants, the aged, the infirm, and those who attended
    service only once a day, probably a hundred thousand. At the present
    day the parishes of Greater London frequently include eight thousand to
    twenty thousand souls.

  <p>
    The last years of Queen Anne were distracted, as readers of history
    know, by secret conferences, correspondence, and conspiracies to secure
    the succession of the elder Pretender, James Francis. The reports and
    whispers of these things kept London in a state of continual alarm
    and ferment; rumours were constantly spreading around; it was said
    that a large number of disaffected persons calling themselves Mohocks
    and Hawkabites came out at night and scoured the streets, assaulting
    and wounding harmless persons; it was also said that they flattened
    the noses of those they seized, or slit them; that they cut off their
    ears; that they stretched their mouths or gagged them; that they
    cruelly pricked and stabbed them; that they set women on their heads,
    with other terrible things. The citizens were afraid to go into the
    streets at night for fear of being “mohocked.” A proclamation was
    issued offering a reward of one hundred pounds for the conviction of
    every such offender. But no one was apprehended, nor could any one be
    found who had suffered from the cruelties of the so-called Mohocks and
    Hawkabites. In fact it was a scare, baseless except for the occasional
    acts of violence which took place in the streets. Another scare was
    started about the same time. It was bruited abroad that the suburbs
    and fields around London were haunted by a wretch called Whipping
    Tom, whose practice it was to seize on all the women he met with and
    flog them. No one asked how this could be done if the woman resisted
    or ran away, because one would want both hands for the purpose, and
    the fields—meaning Moor Fields—and suburbs were not so lonely that a
    woman’s cries could not be heard. However, the women of London were put
    into a state of great terror in consequence of this report, and for a
    long time none would venture abroad without an escort.
  </p>

  <p>
    At this time there were complaints that many shopkeepers employed
    assistants who were not Freemen of the City. The Mayor and Common
    Council passed a strict order that this practice was to cease, and that
    the persons employed in the City in any capacity should be Freemen of
    the City.

  <p class="noindent">
    <span class="smcap">Let</span> us consider the religious side of London in the first half of the
    seventeenth century. It was not so much the abolition of the Mass and
    all that went with it, not so much the Smithfield fires and all that
    they meant, that changed the mind of London, but the acquisition of
    the Bible and the continual delight which the people found in reading
    it, in hearing it read, in hearing it expounded, and in making out for
    themselves the meaning of passages and the foundations of doctrine. The
    Bible gave them histories more entrancing than any that had ever been
    presented to them. They read of Abraham and of Jacob, of Joshua, of the
    Strong Man, of the rash King’s vow, of Saul and David, of Hezekiah, of
    Elijah and the prophets of Baal. They read the words of the Prophets
    and applied them to the events and the kings and statesmen of their
    own time; if they longed to praise their God, the Psalms of David gave
    them words; if they were sad they found consolation in those poems;
    for the conduct of life there was the Book of Proverbs; for example,
    under every possible circumstance was a gallery of portraits, the like
    of which could nowhere else be found. In the Gospel they read of a
    Christ whose image rose always higher than they could reach; and in the
    Epistles they gathered materials for the doctrines of a hundred sects.
    With this book in their hands, containing history, poetry, morals,
    example, admonition, the way of eternal life and, scattered about, the
    materials for the Creed or Articles of Faith, without which it seemed
    impossible to live, the old authority was gone, never to return so
    long as that book remained in the hands and sank into the minds of the
    people.
  </p>

  <p>
    For forty years and more before the Stuarts came, the book had been
    read and read again and again by every one; children had read it at
    school; they had been catechised in it; they had been taught that it
    contained in itself the whole of religion, so that what had been added
    since was superfluous or superstitious.
  </p>

  <p>
    The attitude of the people towards Catholicism at the beginning of
    the seventeenth century was that of hatred far beyond the hatred of
    fifty years before, because it was intensified by the terror of the
    Papacy, which seemed recovering its old ground
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span> and quickly seizing on
    one country after another. It seemed to those that could look beyond
    the sea that in a short time there would be another, and a far more
    dangerous attempt than that of the Spanish Armada, upon the religion
    and the liberties of the country. The horrors of Catholic victory were
    impressed upon them by the spectacle of the Huguenot fugitives and the
    unfortunate Palatines, by stories of the Spanish Inquisition and its
    ruthless tortures. The preachers—those “lecturers”—who were added to
    the parish churches, fed this feeling of hatred and of terror. What,
    then, was the indignation, what was the dismay, when the citizens of
    London found the ecclesiastical authorities separating themselves
    more and more from the reformed churches of Germany and Switzerland,
    and, as they thought, advancing with no uncertain steps towards a
    reconciliation with Rome!

  <p>
    The early years of the seventeenth century saw the Puritan at his best.
    That he should prefer and hold a narrow creed was inevitable; there
    was no creed or sect possible which was not narrow. In this respect
    the Puritan was in no way below the Catholic, the Episcopalian, the
    Presbyterian, or the Brownist, or the Fifth Monarchy man, or any other
    sectarian. He was not, however, necessarily a gloomy and austere
    person. He might be a man of many accomplishments; Colonel Hutchinson
    fenced, danced, and played the viol. But the Puritan was, above all,
    conscious of his own individual responsibility. Between himself and
    his God he wanted no priest; he would not acknowledge that there was
    for any man the need of a priest, or for any priest the possession
    of supernatural power; he wanted no ceremonies; he remembered that
    symbolism, as all history proclaims aloud, leads infallibly to the
    worship of the symbol. He would not allow so simple a thing as the
    sign of the cross in baptism or the ring in marriage. The key-note of
    Puritanism, the thing which made it strong and glorified it in the
    persons of the best and noblest spirits, as Milton and Hutchinson, was
    that the man was master of himself. Consider, therefore, the wrath and
    the dismay when such a man saw himself, or thought himself deprived of
    his liberty of thought, compelled to conformity with what he held to be
    superstitions, dragged unwillingly and in chains along the road to Rome.
  </p>

  <p>
    Among the lower ranks, the shopkeepers and the craftsmen of London,
    the same spirit prevailed; but it led to extravagances. The Bible
    was kept open on every counter; men discussed texts in every tavern;
    the barbers quoted Paul while they shaved their customers. A certain
    description of a citizen’s wife suggests the thought and discourse of a
    London household of this time. “She was very loving and obedient to her
    parents, kind to her husband, tender-hearted to her children, loving
    all who were godly, much misliking the wicked and profane; ... very
    ripe and perfect in all stories of the Bible; <em>likewise in all stories
    of Martyrs</em>.” The martyrs were the Marian martyrs; this good woman
    knew them all; there would be more martyrs, she knew full well, if the
    Catholics came back. And she knew, and delighted in, all the stories of
    the Bible; she was ripe in them and perfect in them. If the Catholics
    came back, her Bible would be taken from her. Consider the dismay of
    this poor woman when she was told that Laud was doing all he could to
    bring them back!
  </p>

  <p>
    Green points out, very forcibly and truly, how the claims of despotic
    authority, of crown and church, jarred with all that was noblest in
    the temper of the time. “These were everywhere reaching forward to the
    conception of law. Bacon sought the law in material nature; Hooper
    asserted the rule of law over the spiritual world. The temper of the
    Puritan was eminently a temper of law. The diligence with which he
    searched the Scriptures sprang from his earnestness to discover a
    Divine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
    Will, which, in all things, great or small, he might implicitly
    obey. But this implicit obedience was reserved for the Divine Will
    alone: for human ordinances derived their strength only from their
    correspondence with the revealed law by God.” Against such a temper,
    with such a stubborn people, fully persuaded that their eternal welfare
    depended upon their adherence to their own convictions, Charles and
    Laud were bound to fail.

    It must be admitted that the better type of Puritan was apt to
    degenerate and to give way to a narrower and a stricter school.
    There appeared the Puritan who pulled down and cut in pieces the
    Maypoles—those of St. Andrew Undershaft, and of Basing Lane, for
    example. Also there appeared the Puritan who put down games and sports:—

    There appeared also the Puritan who objected to the study of Latin and
    Greek as encouraging idolatry and pagan superstition. And the Puritan
    who would have no Christmas festivities, who put down the custom of
    plum porridge, and changed the name of Christmas pie to mince-pie,
    which it is still called. The gloomy face of the Puritan belongs to
    later developments, as do the texts worn on the sleeve, the lank hair,
    and the hat without a band.
  </p>

  <p>
    With such a temper in the people, against such leaders, Charles and
    Laud began their campaign for the overthrow of civil and religious
    liberty. It is easy to exclaim against a short-sighted policy, and
    against the blindness of those who could not observe the signs of the
    times. In the absence of newspapers and public meetings, how was a
    statesman to understand the signs of the times? The King, like his
    father, had not been brought up in the knowledge of English liberties
    and their history. To this ignorance a great deal of the blundering,
    both of James and of Charles, may be attributed. Laud, for his part,
    was an ecclesiastic through and through. It was not for him to seek
    out the opinions of the unlearned or of the dissentient. It was his
    business to enforce the ecclesiastical law as he found it, and as he
    designed to make it.
  </p>

  <p>
    The number of London clergy afterwards ejected sufficiently proves the
    support which he obtained from that class. It is, indeed, always safe
    to expect support from the clergy whenever steps are taken to magnify
    the ecclesiastical office or to advance the sacerdotal pretensions. As
    it is in our time, so it was in the days of Laud.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Archbishop ordered conformity with the ceremonies of the Prayer
    Book. The surplice was enforced; the sign of the Cross in Baptism was
    continued; the ring in marriage remained in use; kneeling, and not
    sitting, at the administration of the Holy Communion became obligatory.
    The Geneva Bible, the old favourite of the people, with its short and
    pithy notes, was prohibited; those ministers who refused to conform
    were ejected; the lectures, which in London had been mostly on the
    Puritan side, were suppressed.
  </p>

  <p>
    It became evident fifteen years later that the intolerance of Laud
    was not so much a subject of complaint as the enforcement of ritual
    and teaching abhorrent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
    to the mind of Puritan, Presbyterian, and
    Independent. In 1644 it was proved that intolerance belonged equally to
    all sects. The possibility of allowing people differing in creeds to
    live in peace was not as yet admitted; nor would it be admitted until
    all alike, Anglican, Presbyterian, Independent, Quaker, Anabaptist,
    Socinian, Roman Catholic, had each and all in turn felt and realised
    that religion would mean continuous persecution, ejection, rebellion,
    and suffering, unless a <i xml:lang="la">modus vivendi</i> were arrived at.

  <p>
    Meantime those who would be intolerant in their turn, but as yet could
    not, found the situation gloomy. They looked across the Atlantic and
    began to emigrate by thousands; not, as is too often asserted, to find
    across the ocean that freedom which they could not find here, but to
    find the power of living under the creed that they accepted, and of
    imposing it upon all who would live among them.
  </p>

  <p>
    “The Land,” says Clarendon, “was full of pride and mutiny.” It seemed,
    at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
    one time, as if the best blood of the country was going across
    the ocean. Hundreds of the clergy gave up their houses and went into
    poverty because they would not turn a table into an altar, and because
    they refused to take the least step which pointed in the direction of
    Rome.
  </p>

  <p>
    And persecution and public punishment of men like Leighton and Prynne
    only had the effect of bringing the discontent of the people to the
    point of exasperation.

      EXECUTION OF WILLIAM LAUD, ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY (1645)

  </div>

  <p>
    In the year 1633 appeared Prynne’s <cite>Histrio Mastix</cite>, a violent attack
    on play-acting, dancing, and masques. In all these things the Queen
    took great delight. Therefore the work was supposed to be directed
    against her. A brutal sentence was inflicted upon Prynne, and was
    duly carried out, and after pillory, branding on the forehead, having
    his nose slit and his ears cut off, the wretched man was condemned
    to be disbarred, to be deprived of his University degree, and to be
    imprisoned for life.
  </p>

  <p>
    The freedom of the press was of course attacked. Laud assumed a
    censorship<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
    over all new books and over the sale or circulation of
    old books. Among other books prohibited were Foxe’s <cite>Book of Martyrs</cite>
    and Bishop Jewel’s <cite>Works</cite>. Prynne, and with him Dr. Bastwick, a
    physician, and Henry Burton, a divine, all three being prisoners in
    the Tower, were prosecuted in the Star Chamber for writing libellous
    and schismatical books. They were sentenced to pay £5000 each; to
    stand in pillory; to lose their ears, or, in Prynne’s case, to lose
    what was left of his ears; to be branded and to be imprisoned in
    Launceston, Lancaster, and Carnarvon. An immense multitude gathered to
    see the sentence carried out; they “cried and howled terribly”; they
    followed the prisoners with shouts of good wishes and groans for their
    persecutors; they threw money into the coach in which Burton’s wife was
    sitting. Laud complained afterwards that the prisoners were suffered to
    speak to the people, and that notes were taken of their speeches and
    circulated in the City. At Chester, on his way to Carnarvon, Prynne was
    entertained by the Sheriff and a number of gentlemen, who refreshed him
    with a good dinner, and gave him tapestry and carpets for his cell.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let us turn to the other side of religious opinion. If the Bible,
    and especially the Old Testament, furnished the popular side with
    arguments in support of every doctrine they professed, the same
    authority was called in for the maintenance and defence of the High
    Church and Loyalist party. Laud and his friends were by no means
    without Scriptural defence. For instance, the most rigid rule of
    conduct advanced by the divines of Charles the Second’s reign was that
    of passive obedience, together with the corollary that resistance
    to the King’s authority was a mortal sin. This doctrine seems to us
    absurd, we who inherit the training of two hundred years in the belief
    that all power is conferred by the people and may be withdrawn by
    the people. But, in fact, the doctrine was perfectly logical if one
    admitted that the English monarchy was an Oriental despotism such as
    that of Solomon or any other Eastern king. I have before me a sermon
    preached on February 6, 1668, in Ripon Cathedral, by the Dean, in which
    the doctrine is boldly advanced and upheld. The text is from 1 Kings
    viii. 66, and relates how, after the great and solemn function of the
    dedication with the blood of 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep—surely there
    is here a superfluity of ciphers—and after a great feast, the people
    went away blessing the King. One would think this a weak text for the
    support of such a doctrine, but the learned Dean bolsters it up with
    an abundance of instances and texts. Thus “St. Paul says that Kings
    are, not by God’s sufferance but by his ordinance, and therefore, even
    supposing them never so bad, they are not to be resisted. You may take
    up the Buckles of Patience; but you must not take up Arms against them;
    for Rebellion is such rank Poison to the Soul, that the least Scruple
    of it is Damnable, the very intention of it in the Heart is Mortal.”
  </p>

  <p>
    In our passive obedience we may, if times are bad, console ourselves
    with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
    imitation of “Jeremiah in Prison; Daniel in the Lion’s Den;
    Amos struck through the Temples; Zachariah murdered between the Porch
    and the Altar; our Blessed Saviour living under Herod and Tiberius and
    crucified under Pontius Pilate; His Disciples under Caligula, Claudius,
    Nero, and Domitian; Christian Bishops, under Heathen Persecutors; none
    of whom ever reviled their Princes or resisted them.” One might object
    that in these cases resistance would have been useless. But he goes on,
    “Who questioned Saul for slaying the Priests and revolting to Idolatry?
    Who questioned Joram a Parricide and murderer of his nobles? Or Joash
    for his Idolatry and slaying the High Priest? Did the Sanhedrim do
    it? Who questioned Theodosius for murdering six Thousand innocent
    Persons? Who questioned Constance, or Valeros, or Julian the Apostate?”
    Again, one objects the people had not the power to question. Again,
    “Mephibosheth said of David, ‘My Lord the King is an Angel of God. Do
    therefore what is good in thine eyes.’”
  </p>

  <p>
    “Did not God ordain Adam to rule over his wife without giving her or
    her children any commission to limit his power? What was given to
    him in his Person was also given to his Posterity; and the Paternal
    Government continued Monarchical from him to the Flood, and after that
    to the Confusion of Babel when Kingdoms were first erected and planted
    over the face of the Earth? And so what right or Title, the People can
    have ... to restrain the supremacy which was as untouched in Adam as
    any act of his will (it being due to the Supreme Fatherhood) or from
    what time it commenced, the Scripture nowhere tells us. Where is the
    People’s charter extant in Nature or in Scripture, for invading the
    Rights of the Crown? Or what authority can they have from either to
    introduce their Devices of presiding over him whom God and Nature hath
    set over them?”
  </p>

  <p>
    This was the kind of preaching which was heard from a hundred pulpits
    in the City of London as well as in country churches and cathedrals
    during the whole reign of Charles II. and the beginning of his
    successor’s short period of power. There can be no doubt that it
    persuaded many, that the preachers themselves were in earnest, and that
    there were few indeed among the congregation who were able to point to
    the weakness of a doctrine which rested on an absurdity so great as the
    parallel between the King of a free people whose liberties had slowly
    developed from prehistoric customs and an Oriental despotism.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let us note one or two points of custom and popular belief and practice
    which should be taken into account when we consider the religious
    spirit of the time.
  </p>

  <p>
    Fasting, for instance, was still practised and enjoined by the Church,
    as it is to this day. The Puritans, while they rebelled against the
    observance of days, maintained the duty of occasional fast days. The
    High Church party insisted vehemently on the duty of fasting, and the
    Restoration brought back the usage of fasting as part of the Church
    discipline. By this time, however, the poorer classes
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span> had lost the
    habit of eating fish only on Fridays and in Lent, and it was impossible
    to enforce the practice.
  </p>

  <p>
    Other customs and beliefs, survivals of the old faith, remained.
    Sanctuary, for example, although the ancient privileges had been
    abolished, although a criminal could no longer take refuge in a
    church, still continued under another form (see <a href="#Page_170">p. 170</a>). That is
    to say, certain places remained where Sheriffs’ officers could not
    venture, where a writ could not be served, and where a rogue could
    not be arrested. Among these places were the streets on the site of
    Whitefriars: Ram Alley, Salisbury Court, Mitre Court, the Precinct of
    the Savoy, Fulwood’s Rents in Holborn, and on the other side of the
    river, Deadman’s Place, the Mint, and Montagu Close. These pretended
    privileges were not abolished by law until the year 1697. Some of the
    places, in spite of this abolition, preserved their immunity for a
    time by the terror of their lawlessness and violence. The “humours” of
    Alsatia have been immortalised by Scott, but it must be remembered that
    there were many other places besides Whitefriars at that time equally
    entitled to the privileges of sanctuary.
  </p>

  <p>
    The abolition of Episcopacy was followed by a persecution of those of
    the clergy who were known to sympathise with the Anglican forms. They
    were accused of immorality or malignancy; they were haled before the
    House, which deprived them of their livings and gave them to persons
    of better principles. Of the sufferings of the London clergy, Walker’s
    well-known work gives a full account. He sums up as follows:—
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “Thus were about One Hundred and Ten of the London Clergy turned
      out of their Livings (nor do I know whether the List be yet
      compleat), above Forty of which were Doctors of Divinity, and most
      of them Plunder’d of their Goods, and their Wives and Children
      turned out of Doors. About twenty were imprisoned in London, and
      in the Ships, and in the several Jayls and Castles in the Country;
      upward of that Number fled to prevent the like Imprisonment.
      About Twenty Two died soon after in remote Parts, in Prisons, and
      with Grief; and about Forty Churches lay void, having no constant
      Minister in them.
    </p>

    <p>
      They were most, if not all, of them turned out in the Years 1642
      and 1643. Some few more immediately by the House of Commons;
      but most of them by the Committee of Religion, and that of
      Plunder’d Ministers, and chiefly, as I conceive, by the latter:
      The Resolutions of which Committee were in the beginning, if I
      mistake not, mostly reported to the House: But when that Godly Work
      increas’d upon their hands, a Power was lodg’d in the Committee, as
      I take it, which made their Resolutions Final. I must here add that
      a Learned and Eminent Person who liv’d through, and suffer’d under
      those Times, gives this Character of the then London Clergy in
      general: ‘That for a more Pious, Learn’d, and Laborious Ministry,
      no People ever Enjoy’d it, even their enemies themselves being
      Judges’” (John Walker, <cite>Account of the Sufferings of the Clergy</cite>,
      1714, p. 180).
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    In June 1643 a council or company of one hundred and twenty divines,
    called “Pious, godly, and judicious,” was summoned to meet at
    Westminster to consider the new form of national church. With them
    were joined thirty laymen, namely, ten Lords and twenty Commoners. The
    Houses laid down rules for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
    form of the meetings and the subject
    of the debates. Among the hundred and twenty was a certain proportion
    of Episcopalians, who, however, refused to attend; the majority were
    Presbyterians, anxious to establish the discipline and doctrine of
    the foreign reformed churches; but there was also among them a small
    body of Independents. The difference between the two parties was
    very important. The former desired a church resembling that of the
    old Established Church in a gradation of spiritual authorities in
    presbyteries, classes, synods, and assemblies, giving to these bodies
    the power of censure, punishment, deprivation, and excommunication.
    The latter held that every congregation stood by itself, that there
    should be no central authority, and that churches should be left free
    to differ in doctrine.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Council were unanimous in minor points; they removed organs; they
    prohibited the surplice and the cope; they destroyed monuments of
    idolatry, but they could not agree as to church government. Finally,
    they agreed in the production of a Directory of public worship, which
    introduced order into the service and regulated the administration of
    the sacraments, the ceremony of marriage, the visitation of the sick,
    and the burial of the dead.
  </p>

  <p>
    On Friday, January 3, 1645, the Ordinance for the abolition of the
    Book of Common Prayer, and for the establishment in its place of a new
    Directory for the public worship of God, was passed:—
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “In the Preamble it is set forth that the ‘Lords and Commons
      assembled in Parliament, taking into serious consideration
      the manifold inconveniences that have arisen by the Book of
      Common-Prayer in this Kingdome, and resolving according to their
      Covenant to reforme Religion according to the Word of God and
      the example of the best Reformed Churches, have consulted with
      the Reverend, Pious and Learned Divines, called together to
      that purpose; And doe Judge it necessary that the said Book of
      Common-Prayer be abolished, and the Directory for the Publike
      Worship of God herein after mentioned, bee established and observed
      in all the Churches within this Kingdome.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “And that the Directory for publike Worship herein set forth shall
      bee henceforth used, perused, and observed according to the true
      intent and meaning of this Ordinance, in all Exercises of the
      Publike Worship of God, in every Congregation, Church, Chappell,
      and place of Publike Worship within this Kingdome of England, and
      Dominion of Wales; Which Directory for the Publike Worship of God,
      with the Preface thereof followeth” (<cite>The Directory</cite>, p. 4).
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    The same preamble ordered that in every church there should be kept a
    register for the names of all who were baptized, married, or buried in
    the churchyard.
  </p>

  <p>The Directory may be condensed as follows:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      1. Orderly behaviour in Church without salutations, greetings, or
      whispering.
    </p>

    <p>2. Commencement with Prayer.</p>

    <p>
      “In all reverence and Humility acknowledging the incomprehensible
      Greatnesse and Majesty of the Lord (in whose presence they doe
      then in a speciall manner appeare) and their owne vilenesse to
      approach so neare him; with their utter inability of themselves, to
      so great a work: And humbly beseeching him for pardon, Assistance,
      and Acceptance in the whole service then to be performed; and for
      a Blessing on that particular portion of his Word then to be read:
      and all, in the Name and Mediation of the Lord Jesus Christ.”
    </p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span></p>

    <p>
      3. After prayer reading of the scriptures; the length and the
      portion chosen to be left to the Minister, with a recommendation to
      read one chapter of the Old and one of the New at every meeting.
    </p>

    <p>
      4. Expounding of the Scripture read to be performed after the
      reading.
    </p>

    <p>
      5. After the Reading, Public Prayer, the general heads of which are
      set forth at length.
    </p>

    <p>6. The Sermon.</p>

    <p>Here follow instructions for the preacher.</p>

    <p>7. After the sermon, another prayer.</p>

    <p>
      8. The Prayer ended, let a Psalm be sung, if with conveniency it
      may be done.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    The rite of baptism is ordered; one notes that the sign of the Cross is
    omitted.
  </p>

  <p>
    The celebration of the Lord’s Supper is to take place after the sermon
    and psalm. The communicants are to sit round a table covered with a
    white cloth. Prayer is to be offered, in which it is to be specially
    noted that the bread and wine remain bread and wine, but that by faith
    the body and blood of Christ are taken by the communicant.
  </p>

  <p>
    The “Sanctification of the Lord’s Day” assumes that it is the Sabbath,
    and orders that no unnecessary work be carried on, and that the same
    not spent in church is to be devoted to reading, meditation, and
    catechising.
  </p>

  <p>
    The marriage service is very short. There is to be a prayer with a
    declaration of Scripture on the subject, after which the man and the
    woman are to take hands and take each other for wife and husband:—
  </p>

  <blockquote>

    <p>
      “Concerning the Burial of the Dead,” the <cite>Directory</cite> says, “and
      because the customes of kneeling down, and praying by, or towards
      the dead Corps, and other such usages, in the place where it lies,
      before it be carried to Buriall, are Superstitious: and for that,
      praying, reading, and singing both in going to, and at the Grave,
      have been grosly abused, are no way beneficiall to the dead, and
      have proved many ways hurtfull to the living; therefore let all
      such things be laid aside.”
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    On days of fasting there is to be total abstinence from all kinds of
    food and from all kinds of work.
  </p>

  <p>As for singing of Psalms:—</p>

  <blockquote>

    <p>
      “The voice is to be tunably and gravely ordered: but the chief care
      must be, to sing with understanding, and with Grace in the heart,
      making melody unto the Lord.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “That the whole Congregation may joyne herein, every one that can
      read is to have a Psalme book, and all others not disabled by
      age, or otherwise, are to be exhorted to learn to read. But for
      the present, where many in the Congregation cannot read, it is
      convenient that the Minister, or some other fit person appointed
      by him and the other Ruling Officers, doe read the Psalme, line by
      line, before the singing thereof” (<cite>Directory</cite>, p. 43).
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    On the 23rd of August following, another ordinance was passed for the
    taking away of the Book of Common Prayer from all churches and chapels
    in the kingdom. It was also ordered that the knights and burgesses of
    the counties should send copies of the Directory, bound in leather, to
    the constables and other officers of every parish in the kingdom, and
    that within one week after receiving the books, the constables should
    hand the books to the minister of the parish.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span></p>

  <p>
    Pains and penalties for disobedience to these orders conclude the
    Ordinance.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are abundant materials for showing the violence of the passions
    excited in London by the religious controversy of the time. We see
    the soldiers on guard at Lambeth breaking into the church in time of
    service, tearing the Prayer Book to pieces, stripping the clergyman of
    his surplice, and desecrating the altar, until the Thames watermen come
    to the assistance of the people and there is a fight in the body of the
    church. We see a party of horse riding through the streets, four of
    them attired in surplices, tearing the Book of Common Prayer in pieces,
    leaf by leaf, with gestures unseemly. We find the clergy accused of the
    most infamous crimes—“common drunkenness, looseness of life, adultery,”
    and worse. We find some of the people in church sitting with their hats
    on, and some with their hats off, and riots in consequence. We hear of
    fanatics preaching the wildest doctrines and forming the most wonderful
    sects. There is neither tolerance, nor charity, nor patience. There is
    no authority; there is no respect for learning; every one, in every
    station, interprets Scripture in blind confidence that he is fully
    equal to the task of framing a bran-new constitution for a bran-new
    sect. And with it all, a power almost pathetic, of sitting out the
    longest sermons. On one occasion two ministers, one after the other,
    engaged the attention of the House of Commons for seven long hours. The
    people presently grew weary of the incessant wranglings over doctrine;
    sane persons began to understand that the task of making ignorant
    men and women agree in matters of creed was hopeless; it became
    understood that divergence of opinion would be no more tolerated by
    Independents than it was by Presbyterians; at this point of weariness
    it was extremely fortunate for the country that the reaction restored
    them to the Church of England instead of the Church of Rome. It was
    wonderful how the great mass of the people sank back contentedly into
    their old form of faith, relieved to find at last that they might leave
    the dogmas of religion to divines and scholars and be free themselves
    to illustrate in their private lives the virtues of religion by the
    exercise of faith, hope, and charity, which, for twenty years and more,
    seemed to have deserted the City of London.
  </p>

  <p>
    A single example of the religious dissensions of the time will
    doubtless stand for many more. I have before me a pamphlet written by
    the Rev. J. Dodd, which originally appeared in the <cite>English Historical
    Review</cite> (Spottiswoode, 1895), on the troubles of St. Botolph, Aldgate,
    during this period. To quote Mr. Dodd’s own words, “it is a fairly
    complete picture of the state of discord, and probably had many a
    parallel throughout England.”
  </p>

  <p>
    In 1642 the then Vicar, a follower of Laud, one Thomas Swadlin, was
    deprived of his living and sent to Newgate. After his departure the
    living was held by a succession of obscure preachers, probably of
    Puritanic views, till 1654, when Laurence Wise, the last of them,
    either died or resigned. In August of that year, by popular election,
    one John Mackarness, a clergyman in Anglican orders, was appointed.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
    Cromwell, however, intervened, and a Presbyterian, Zachary Crofton, was
    appointed in his place. Crofton was an Irishman who had been in arms
    against the King; he was then pastor, first of Newcastle-under-Lyne,
    next of Winbury, in Cheshire. He refused to take the oath to the
    Government of 1649 “without King or House of Lords,” and lost his
    living. In London he obtained the church of St. James’s, Garlickhithe.
    Here he made himself known as a hot-headed controversialist, and by
    no means a friend of Cromwell, who, however, nominated him to St.
    Botolph’s.
  </p>

  <p>
    Crofton went, therefore, to St. Botolph’s, and found a congenial field
    for a fighting man. He was himself a Presbyterian; the afternoon
    lecturer was one John Simpson, who had also, like Crofton, been in the
    Army, and was now an Independent and an Anabaptist. Crofton alienated
    some of the former sect by attempting to revive “disception” in his
    church—that is to say, he forbade unworthy persons from approaching the
    Lord’s Table. He enraged the Anabaptists by the importance which he
    attached to the baptism of infants. He also desired to catechise the
    children, and printed a short catechism for them. Simpson held that you
    might as well buy rattles or hobby horses for children as catechisms.
    Crofton began by refusing to recognise Simpson as afternoon lecturer;
    the parishioners petitioned Cromwell to allow him one lecture in the
    church on the Lord’s Day and one in the week. This was granted, and
    Crofton had to give way.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then occurred a charge which Crofton always denied, but which was
    brought up against him continually. A certain maid-servant accused him
    of chastising her with a rod in an improper manner. Afterwards she
    swore that she had been bribed to bring the accusation.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 1657 Crofton sent a letter to John Simpson; he was going to take
    possession of his own pulpit, and Simpson might commence an action
    as soon as he pleased. Simpson, however, complained to the Council
    of State, and an order was granted him to preach in the afternoon.
    Accordingly on Sunday, Crofton being in the pulpit and surrounded
    by his friends, John Simpson and his party entered the church and
    presented the order. It was addressed to Grafton, not Crofton. “This
    order is not for me,” said the Vicar; whereupon the Simpson party
    retired, beaten for once. The Council of State again interfered and
    Crofton had to submit. He took revenge by charging Simpson’s three
    principal friends with brawling in church. They were acquitted; he
    made a public protest in the church. John Simpson then began to preach
    against infant baptism; Crofton charged him with heresy and demanded
    of him a defence of his position. Simpson preserved silence. But he
    took other steps. He charged Crofton with being a declared enemy to
    the Government and with preaching sedition and insurrection. Crofton
    refused to acknowledge the jurisdiction of the Court. He published a
    pamphlet, however, in which he defended himself and told a pretty story
    of parish dissensions and persecutions. After this came the whirlwind.
    Cromwell died. Crofton went into the country just before
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span> the Cheshire
    rising, and was charged with preaching to the rebels; from this he
    cleared himself. He then threw himself into the politics of the time,
    strongly advocating a free Parliament; he preached at St. Peter’s,
    Cornhill, for the restoration of Charles the Second; meantime John
    Simpson had vanished and the magnanimous Crofton preached a sermon
    on peace. He lost his church at the Restoration; he was consigned to
    the Tower for a twelvemonth; he went down into Cheshire and turned
    cheese-factor; he was again arrested for sowing sedition; he went
    back to London and started a grocer’s shop; under the pressure of
    the Five Mile Act he left London and took a farm at Little Barford
    in Bedfordshire; after the Plague he returned to London and set up a
    school in Aldgate; it was here that he preached a course of sermons
    in St. James’s, Duke’s Place, which he afterwards published under the
    title of “The Saints’ Care for Church Communion.” He died just before
    Christmas 1672, and his body lies buried in the churchyard of his old
    parish.
  </p>

  <p>
    This story illustrates the feverish unrest of the time: the parish
    divided into furious parties; one clergyman preaching infant baptism;
    the other preaching that it was as idle to give the child a catechism
    as a rattle; calumniations and recriminations of the vilest kind; the
    Restoration; ejections; an attempt to earn a living by making cheese,
    by farming, by keeping a shop, by keeping a school. A strange story of
    a strange time!
  </p>

  <p>
    As a part of the religious aspect of the City one must not omit the
    desecration of St. Paul’s, which, during the twenty years 1640–1660,
    was carried out in a manner so resolute and thorough as to show the
    deliberate intention of giving the citizens, who still gloried in their
    venerable Cathedral, a lesson in the revolution of religious thought.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Cathedral, as Dean Milman says, was, under the Puritans, a vast
    useless pile, the lair of old superstition and idolatry. It would have
    been pulled down but for the trouble and the expense. The Parliament,
    however, did what they could to procure its destruction; there was a
    sum of £17,000 lying in the chambers of the City which remained out of
    the subscriptions for repairing the church. This was seized. There had
    also been erected round the tower a scaffolding of wood which was taken
    down and sold for £174, the whole being given to Colonel Jefferson’s
    regiment for arrears of pay. When the scaffolding was taken away,
    part of the roof of the south transept fell in. Whereupon the Mayor
    and Aldermen represented the necessity of getting more water into the
    City, and begged the lead that covered the roof towards the pipes for
    carrying the water.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 1642 the removal of crucifixes and other superstitious objects was
    ordered. In the same year all the copes belonging to the Cathedral were
    burned. In 1645 the silver plate of St. Paul’s was sold, and the money
    spent in providing artillery.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Cathedral, according to the story, was offered by Cromwell to
    the Jews, who refused to buy it. The east end was walled off for the
    congregation of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
    lecturer, Cornelius Burgess. Inigo’s portico was
    let out in small shops to sempstresses and hucksters, with chambers
    above and stairs leading to them. The body of the church became a
    cavalry barrack and stable. Paul’s Cross was pulled down.
  </p>

  <p>
    The intolerance of the time may be illustrated by a hundred stories.
    Take, for instance, the punishment of the unfortunate James Naylor.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the 18th day of December 1656 a man stood in pillory for two hours
    at the Old Palace Yard, Westminster. The case attracted some attention
    because the man was a crack-brained enthusiast, originally in the
    Society of Friends, who had been parading on horseback accompanied
    by three women and one or two men singing, “Holy, Holy, Holy is the
    Lord God of Hosts.” These people also called him the Everlasting Son
    of Righteousness, the Prince of Peace, the Fairest of Ten Thousand.
    The whole company were arrested and sent to London, where Parliament
    considered the case of the man, whose name was James Naylor.
  </p>

  <p>
    In accordance with their sentence, he was first placed in pillory at
    Westminster for two hours; he was then taken down, tied to the cart’s
    tail, and whipped by the hangman all the way to the Old Exchange in
    the City. He received three hundred and ten strokes, and should have
    received one more, “there being three hundred and eleven kennels”—I
    know not what this means. By this time he was in a most pitiful
    condition, as may be imagined. According to the sentence, he should
    have stood in pillory for two hours more, and then have had his tongue
    bored with a red-hot iron, but he could no longer stand. Therefore he
    was respited for a week. At the end of that time, although many people
    petitioned for his pardon, the other part of the sentence was most
    cruelly inflicted. This was not all. As soon as he recovered he was
    sent on to Bristol, where he was flogged through the town and laid in
    prison.
  </p>

  <p>
    The case of James Naylor happened in the Commonwealth. But religious
    toleration was no more understood under a King than under a Protector.
    The sufferings of the Quakers in the reign of Charles the Second prove
    this fact. In 1662 there were 4200 of this Society imprisoned in
    various parts of England either for frequenting meetings or refusing to
    take oaths or for keeping away from Church. Some of them were crowded
    into prisons so close that there was not room for all to sit down at
    once; they were tradesmen, shopkeepers, and husbandmen; their property
    was confiscated; they were refused straw to lie upon; they were often
    denied food. Here is an extract from Sewel:—
  </p>

  <blockquote>

    <p>
      “At London, and in the suburbs, where about this time no less
      than five hundred of those called Quakers, imprisoned, and some
      in such narrow holes, that every person scarcely had convenience
      to lie down; and the felons were suffered to rob them of their
      clothes and money. Many that were not imprisoned, nevertheless
      suffered hardships in their religious meetings, especially that
      in London, known by the name of Bull and Mouth. Here the trained
      bands came frequently, armed generally with muskets,
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>pikes, and
      halbards, and conducted by a military officer, by order of the
      city magistracy; and rushing in, in a very furious manner, fell to
      beating them, whereby many were grievously wounded, some fell down
      in a swoon, and some were beaten so violently, that they lived not
      long after it. Among these was one John Trowel, who was so bruised
      and crushed, that a few days after he died. His friends therefore
      thought it expedient to carry the corpse into the aforesaid meeting
      place, that it might lie there exposed for some hours, to be seen
      of every one. This being done, raised commiseration and pity among
      many of the inhabitants; for the corpse, beaten like a jelly,
      looked black, and was swoln in a direful manner. This gave occasion
      to send for the coroner, and he being come, empannelled a jury of
      the neighbours, and gave them in charge according to his office,
      to make true enquiry upon their oaths, and to present what they
      found to be the cause of his death. They, viewing the corpse, had
      a surgeon or two with them, to know their judgment concerning it;
      and then going together in private, at length they withdrew without
      giving in their verdict, only desiring the friends to bury the
      corpse, which was done accordingly that evening. And though the
      coroner and jury met divers times together upon that occasion, and
      had many consultations, yet they never would give in a verdict;
      but it appeared sufficiently, that the man was killed by violent
      beating. The reasons some gave for the suspense of a verdict were,
      that though it was testified that the same person, now dead, was
      seen beaten, and knocked down; yet it being done in such a confused
      crowd, no particular man could be fixed upon, so that any could
      say, that man did the deed. And if a verdict was given that the
      deceased person was killed, and yet no particular person charged
      with it, then the City was liable to a great fine, at the pleasure
      of the king, for conniving at such a murder in the city in the
      day-time, not committed in a corner, but in a publick place, and
      not apprehending the murderer, but suffering him to escape. In the
      meanwhile the friends of the deceased were not wanting to give
      public notice of the fact, and sent also a letter to the lord
      mayor, which afterwards they gave out in print, together with a
      relation of this bloody business. In this letter it was said, ‘It
      may be supposed thou hast heard of this thing, for it was done not
      in the night, but at the mid-time of the day; not suddenly, at
      unawares, or by mishap, but intendedly, and a long space of time
      a doing; and not in a corner, but in the streets of the city of
      London; all which circumstances do highly aggravate this murder, to
      the very shame and infamy of this famous city and its government’”
      (William Sewel, <cite>History of the Quakers</cite>, 1722, p. 346).

  <p class="noindent">
    <span class="smcap">After</span> the Restoration the religious condition of the City was greatly
    modified. First the Church of England was enormously stronger than it
    had been in any part of Charles the First’s reign. Then the persecution
    of Roman Catholics and Nonconformists affected London more than the
    country, first because many of the former had taken refuge in London,
    and next because the City contained thousands of the latter, some of
    whom obstinately refused any show of conformity. In 1666 the King
    banished all Roman Catholic priests; in the following year he forbade
    his subjects to hear Mass at the Queen’s or any Ambassador’s chapel.
    At the same time he called upon the civil officers to enforce the
    statutes provided. In 1671, when as yet few City churches were rebuilt,
    he ordered that certain places hitherto used as conventicles should be
    used as churches, served by orthodox ministers appointed by the Bishop
    of London:—
  </p>

  <p>
    “In Fisher’s-folly, in Bishopsgate Street—a convenient place, with two
    galleries, pews, and seats.
  </p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span></p>
  <p>
    In Hand-alley, in Bishopsgate Street—a large room, purposely built for
    a meeting-house, with three galleries, thirty large pews, and many
    benches and forms, known by the name of Vincent’s congregation.
  </p>

  <p>
    In St. Michael’s Lane—a large room, with two galleries and thirty-nine
    forms.
  </p>

  <p>
    In Mugwell Street—Mr. Doolittle’s meeting-house, built of brick, with
    three galleries, full of large pews; and thirty-eight large pews below,
    with locks and keys to them, besides benches and forms.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Cockpit in Jewin Street—a meeting-house of one Grimes, many pews,
    forms, and benches.
  </p>

  <p>
    In Blackfriars—Mr. Wood’s meeting-house; four rooms, opening into one
    another, with lattice partitions, each room conveniently fitted with
    benches and forms.
  </p>

  <p>
    In Salisbury Court—four rooms, opening into one another, in the
    possession of John Foule, a schoolmaster.
  </p>

  <p>
    In New Street, within Shoe Lane—four rooms, opening into one another,
    with seventeen pews, and divers benches, in the possession of Mrs.
    Turner.”
  </p>

  <p>
    During the Commonwealth we find certain games forbidden, as the
    “Whimsey Board,” which used to be played in Lincoln’s Inn Fields.
    Persons guilty of playing the virginals in taverns were punished for
    “living loosely.” Search was continually made for Catholics. There
    were dissensions in certain City churches about altar rails and other
    things. The word saint was omitted. Weddings were celebrated by the
    Alderman of the ward, and banns were published in Leadenhall Market.
    The hospitals, with revenues greatly diminished, were used for the
    wounded soldiers. In the same year it was thought necessary to repeat
    the order for the banishment of priests, and in 1673 Catholic recusants
    were forbidden to enter the Palace or Park of St. James’s or the
    precincts of Whitehall. The Catholics, however, continued to flock to
    the Ambassadors’ chapels. It was therefore ordered that messengers of
    the Chamber or other officers should be stationed at the approaches
    to these chapels in order to arrest those proposing to attend service
    there.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 1679 all Roman Catholics in London were ordered to leave the City
    and to withdraw at least ten miles from it.
  </p>

  <p>
    The constant repetition of these ordinances proves that they were
    never enforced save by occasional fits of zeal; the Catholics went
    away; a week later they returned; no doubt the officers were bribed
    to shut their eyes. Yet the system
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span> was most exasperating; for a
    Catholic to be compelled to attend a Protestant service was almost as
    bad as for a Mohammedan to be compelled to eat pig; the Catholic rule
    about attending heretical services is never relaxed; while a zealous
    churchwarden, armed with blank warrants, which he could fill up as he
    pleased in order to arrest and to fine, might make life intolerable.
    A good many young Catholics went abroad for education, and presently
    found it expedient to stay there. The Nonconformists, for their part,
    had no intention of submitting meekly. There were riots and tumults
    in the City. In 1681 the Middlesex magistrates endeavoured to put in
    execution the Act of Charles II.:—
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “Which enacts, that all those who preached in conventicles or
      meetings, contrary to the statutes of the realm, shall not come
      within five miles of a corporation; that no person shall teach
      in any school under the penalty of £40, unless he attend the
      established church. And that of the 20th year of the same reign,
      which ordains, that if any person above sixteen years of age
      attended a religious assembly in a house where more than five
      others, exclusive of the household, were present, except the rites
      were according to the established church, any person preaching
      there should forfeit a certain sum.”
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    It was presently reported, to the blind terror and indignation of the
    zealous, that in certain houses lately erected Catholics had opened
    schools, and had attracted many pupils and numbers of people, their
    parents and relations. It was therefore enacted that those persons
    who, having licences for keeping houses of entertainment, did not
    attend church and, instead, attended any kind of conventicle, should
    lose their licence, and—a very serious blow against Catholics and
    Nonconformists—money should not be given to the poor unless they
    attended church. The Privy Council, having a list of Catholic tradesmen
    in St. Martin’s-in-the-Fields, St. Giles’s, and St. Paul’s, Covent
    Garden, set an example to the City by ordering the Justices of the
    Peace to proceed against them according to law.

    The history of Nonconformity in London has been treated in the book
    of the Eighteenth Century. The following, however, is a list of
    conventicles and preachers in the year 1680:—

    The example of religious discussion and the examination of doctrine
    penetrated, as has been set forth, to the lower classes. A case in
    point is that of Oliver Cromwell’s porter. This man, whose Christian
    name was Daniel, learned in Cromwell’s service much of the cant that
    prevailed at that time. He was a great plodder in books of divinity,
    especially in those of the mystical kind, which are supposed to have
    turned his brain. He was many years in Bedlam, where his library was,
    after some time, allowed him, as there was not the least probability of
    his cure. The most conspicuous of his books was a large Bible given him
    by Nell Gwynne. He frequently preached and sometimes prophesied, and
    was said to have foretold several remarkable events, particularly the
    Fire of London. One would think that Butler had this frantic enthusiast
    in view when he says:—

    Mr. Charles Leslie, who has placed him in the same class with Fox and
    Muggleton, tells us that people often went to hear him preach, and
    “would sit many hours under his window with great signs of devotion.”
    That gentleman had the curiosity to ask a grave matron who was among
    his auditors, “What she could profit by hearing that madman?” She, with
    a composed countenance, as pitying his ignorance, replied, that “Festus
    thought Paul was mad.”

    In the year 1692 one Robert Midgley was moved to speak out on behalf of
    the churches and their services. His pamphlet is useful in showing the
    conduct of the religious services in the City of London at that time.
    He imitated the methods of the theatres in issuing a printed paper of
    services and hours. I omit a portion of his preamble:—
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “And now considering the ways and methods which Satan and his
      Emissaries have taken to fill his Chirches, the Theatres, with
      Votaries, have been (not by Bells, which make a great noise near
      hand and are not heard afar off, but) by silently dispersing their
      Bills, and setting them up at the corners of the streets, whereby
      they do draw People from all Parts to their contagious Assemblies,
      I was easily convinced of the Success of the like Undertaking for
      the Service of Almighty God, and therefore could no longer excuse
      myself for the Omission thereof. These are, therefore, Dearly
      beloved in Christ Jesus, to acquaint you where ye may daily, with
      the congregations of the Faithful, assemble together at the House
      of Prayer; where you may, in Imitation of the Apostles of our Lord,
      every Lord’s Day partake of the blessed Sacrament of the Lord’s
      Supper; and lastly, where there are any extraordinary regular
      Lectures to be heard; in all which, for your good, I have spared no
      pains for the certainty of my own information nor Charges in the
      Dispersing hereof for yours. And now know that the wilful Neglect
      of these means will one day have a sad after-reckoning, and that
      this Paper will then rise up in judgment against you.
    </p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span></p>

    <p>
      If this Paper<a id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> have its desired effect, I trust Almighty God
      will open the hearts of his faithful Labourers, to set up Daily
      Prayer and weekly Communion in many of their own churches, where at
      present it is not.
    </p>

    <p class="mb0">
      For the sake of such as, during the whole time this is dispersing,
      may happen, either by sickness, Absence, or otherwise, not to come
      in the way of it, there shall be of them to be bought, <i>Price one
      Halfpenny</i>, which is also <i>Corban</i>, and therefore put into the
      hands but of one person to sell; whoever else, therefore, does sell
      them, does also Print them, and consequently does not only rob this
      Bookseller of his Copy (which cost the Author so much labour to
      form) but all the Poor also of their just due herein, which it is
      hoped every Christian Buyer will remember and consider.

    From his list it appears that there were four daily services in
    one church, three in seven churches, two in forty-one, and one in
    thirty-six. That the Holy Communion was administered every Sunday in
    eight churches, three times a month in two, twice at two churches, viz.
    the chapels of Gray’s Inn and Lincoln’s Inn, and on the first Sunday
    of the month at all the other churches. As regards the hour, at two
    churches there were two celebrations at 7 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> and noon, in
    two at 6 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, in one at 8 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>;
    in all the rest at noon.
  </p>

  <p>
    There were lectures in three churches at 6 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> every Sunday,
    in one church at 7 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, in one at 10 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, in
    two at 4 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, in ten at 5 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, and in one at 6
    <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> On week days there were four churches where a lecture
    was given once a week at 6 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, one at 9 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>,
    twelve at 10 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, one at 11 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, one at 2
    <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, three at 3 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, four at 4 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, one
    at 5 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, and one at 6 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> Of evening service, as
    we understand it, there was none. It is, however, without doubt that
    all the churches were open practically every day for service, and that
    all the week round a pious person might hear a sermon in the morning
    and another in the evening; or he might run round from church to church
    and hear sermons all day long.

    Charity has always been closely coupled with church-going in theory
    at least. In <a href="#APPENDIX_III">Appendix III</a>. will be found a list of the almshouses of
    London of this period.
  </p>

  <p>
    This list, containing forty-one almshouses in which hospitals are not
    included and seventeen schools, appears to speak well for the charity,
    well directed and deliberate, of the seventeenth century. Out of the
    whole number of almshouses in existence in the year 1756, when this
    list was compiled, the seventeenth century founded nearly the half,
    and of the whole number of endowed schools existing in 1753, the
    seventeenth century contributed exactly one half.
  </p>

  <p>
    Of the greatest of all the “almshouses” founded in the Stuart period,
    viz. Chelsea Hospital, I do not speak in this place, as a full account
    of it is given elsewhere in the Survey.<a id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>

  <p class="noindent">
    <span class="smcap">Foremost</span> among the superstitious beliefs of the century was that of
    witchcraft. It became, indeed, more actively mischievous and more
    real in the minds of the people on account of the universal habit,
    considered as a Christian duty, of referring everything to the Bible,
    as much to the Old as to the New Testament. Theologians of all sects
    believed in witchcraft and in the active interference of the Devil.
    Erasmus and Luther, for instance, were believers in witchcraft, while
    King James wrote on witches. The persecution of miserable old women,
    accused of being witches because they were old and poor, was carried on
    throughout the seventeenth century; it is a frightful record of cruelty
    and superstition, especially in the eastern counties, which were mainly
    Puritan, and therefore even more inclined than the rest of England to
    accept the literal application of the Old Testament to their own time.
    “Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live,” said the Book of Exodus.
    “There shall not be found among you,” said the Book of Deuteronomy,
    “one that useth divinations, or an observer of times, or an enchanter,
    or a witch, or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a
    wizard, or a necromancer.” Could anything be plainer? Again, “Regard
    not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after wizards to be
    defiled with them. I am the Lord your God.”
  </p>

  <p>
    The belief in witchcraft was universal, but the persecution was not; in
    London, though there is no reason to doubt the belief, there are few
    cases on record of the actual persecution of witches. One case is that
    of Sarah Mordyke, who was apprehended at Paul’s Wharf, charged with
    bewitching one Richard Hetheway, near the Falcon Stairs in Southwark.
    She was taken before certain learned Justices in Bow Lane. The victim
    swore that he had lost his appetite, voided pins, etc., but recovered
    when he had scratched and brought blood from Sarah Mordyke, the witch.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another case is that of Sarah Griffith. She lived in Rosemary Lane.
    She had long been considered a bad woman, but nothing could be proved
    against her, though it was suspicious that her neighbours’ children
    were affected with strange distempers, and were affrighted with
    apparitions of cats. One day, however, she was
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span> buying soap in a shop
    when the apprentice laughed at the scales not being right, and said
    they must be bewitched. Whereupon the old woman thought he was laughing
    at her and vowed vengeance. Sure enough, in the night everything in the
    shop was turned topsy-turvy.
  </p>

  <p>
    Two or three days after, the apprentice, with two or three friends, was
    walking towards New River Head when they met Sarah Griffith. It was a
    favourable opportunity to try her, so they tossed her into the canal.
    Instead of drowning she swam like a cork—a sure sign of her guilt.
    When they let her come out she smote the young man on the arm, making
    a mark as black as a coal, and told him he should pay dear for what he
    had done. So he went home in a great fright and died. After this his
    master took a constable and brought her before the Justices, charging
    her with compassing the death of his apprentice by witchcraft. She was
    accordingly committed to the Clerkenwell Bridewell, and I know not what
    became of her afterwards.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have before me a short pamphlet on the tragic history of a young
    gentleman of Stepney who sold himself to the Devil.
  </p>

  <p>
    When one remembers Defoe’s mystification about Mrs. Veal one suspects
    that this story is also an invention, devised for the purpose of
    inspiring godly fear, and based upon popular superstition rather than
    a narrative put together on hearsay, exaggerated as it passed from lip
    to lip. The story is quite in Defoe’s circumstantial manner. A young
    gentleman named Watts, son of Mr. William Watts of Stepney and of
    Anne, daughter of Squire Wilson of Brentwood, was the only survivor of
    four children. He was therefore treated with the greatest indulgence
    and tenderness. After five years at St. John’s College, Oxford, he
    returned home and began to keep evil company, being already ripe in
    wickedness. His parents remonstrated with him, but in vain. Finally,
    his father refused to give him any more money for the support of
    his extravagances. The son, in a great rage, swore that he would be
    revenged upon his parents even to the hazard of his soul. He took a
    lodging at some distance from his father’s house, and fell to devising
    how he might get the estate into his own hands.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now, as he was thus meditating, Satan himself came into the room and
    asked the reason of his sadness. After a little conversation the young
    man consented to sign away his soul with his own blood in return for as
    much money as he could spend in twelve years.
  </p>

  <p>
    When the time approached he went home, struck with terror and remorse,
    and confessed to his father all that he had done.
  </p>

  <p>
    His father sent for certain divines who are duly mentioned, viz. Dr.
    Russel of Wapping, Dr. Sannods, Dr. Smithies, and Dr. Paul. These
    clergymen gathered round the poor wretch, now weeping and wringing his
    hands, and entreated him to pray; but he could not, so they prayed
    for him, but in vain; for in the middle of the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span> night there arose
    a dreadful storm of thunder, lightning, rain, and hail, and in the
    midst of the storm the Devil came into the room “in dreadful shapes,”
    snatched the young man from their midst, dashed out his brains against
    the wall, tore him limb from limb, and scattered the fragments on the
    dunghill behind the house.
  </p>

  <p>
    The pamphlet concludes with a sermon preached upon this doleful
    occasion. The story is, as I said before, either an exaggerated account
    of some local rumour, or it is a deliberate invention, which is, of
    course, the more probable. In either case it proves the continued
    existence of the old traditions about selling one’s self to the Devil,
    of which we find abundant examples among the mediæval chronicles. The
    superstition must be added to those already recorded of the seventeenth
    century.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is needless to add that the bagful of superstitions was swallowed
    whole by people of every rank and class. In the <cite>Spectator</cite> we read how
    the girls vied with each other in telling ghost stories. They watched
    for omens, and made themselves miserable when these were unlucky;
    they remembered their dreams carefully and consulted the <cite>Dictionary
    of Dreams</cite> or the nearest wise woman; they learned what was coming
    by the tingling of the ears, irritation of the nose, specks on the
    nails, and other signs; the meeting of birds and creatures filled them
    with terror; they read warnings in the candle and in the fire; the
    dogs howled in sign of approaching death. Most of these superstitions
    are still with us, more or less. It must, however, be observed that
    London, with its crowded, busy, active life, was far less troubled with
    superstitions than the country; people had no time to worry over signs
    and omens in the midst of their full and busy lives.
  </p>

  <p>
    Lucky and unlucky days played a very important part in the conduct of
    life. Cromwell’s lucky day was the 3rd of September. Thursday was an
    unlucky day for Henry VIII. and his children. Every change of moon
    brought an unlucky day; there were also certain unlucky days in every
    month. Lord Burghley, who despised these observances as a rule, kept
    three days in the year as especially unlucky. The reasons why he
    considered them unlucky mark a great gulf between his time and ours.
    The first Monday in April was one, because on that day Cain was born
    and Abel was killed. The second Monday in August was another, because
    then Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed. The remaining day was the last
    Monday in December, because at that time Judas Iscariot was born. How
    these days were discovered, and why they should be unlucky for all time
    to follow, are questions which it is impossible to answer.
  </p>

  <p>
    Almanacks containing lists of lucky and unlucky days were in great
    request, and continued until quite recently. They were consulted by
    everybody before entering upon any kind of work.
  </p>

  <p>
    The autobiography of William Lilly is valuable for its unconscious
    exposure of fraud, impudence, credulity, and superstition. He lived
    throughout the greater part of the seventeenth century. It was an age
    in which the so-called science of astrology
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span> flourished exceedingly.
    The astrologer not only cast nativities and foretold in general
    terms the future of a man, but also condescended to answer questions
    concerning doubtful points, as in matters of love; found lucky days for
    the commencement of any business or enterprise; discovered thefts and
    thieves; practised physic without preliminary training, and compelled,
    by means of the crystal ball or some other magic, spirits and angels to
    perform their bidding. In all these pretensions and powers Lilly firmly
    believed; yet he was unable to prove them by making the spirits, his
    servants, obey him in great things—such as the rescue of King Charles
    and the triumph of his cause. Moreover, in his simple chat about his
    brethren of the fraternity he is quite unable to see how he gives
    away the whole of his own pretensions by exposing their weakness and
    their failures. Thus one of them “sets a figure” about himself. He
    learns from this figure that he is to be a Lord or great man within
    two years. Alas! in two years he was in Newgate Prison. Another time
    he set his figure, and learned that he was to be a great man within a
    year. But in that year he advanced not one whit. And being consulted
    by a friend about to undertake a voyage, he learned by astrology that
    it would be a fortunate adventure. Unhappily it proved the reverse,
    for the adventurer was taken prisoner by pirates and lost his all. He
    set down four or five other judgments, in every one of which he was
    wrong. Lilly, however, sees in these failures no reflection on the
    “science” at all. Another of them, Evans, a clergyman who had to give
    up his benefice on account of some scandal, lived by giving judgment
    on things lost; he was “much addicted to debauchery,” very abusive
    and quarrelsome; he made and sold antimonial cups, and he was in
    correspondence with an angel named Salmon, whom he ordered to fetch
    and carry for him. His portrait, if it is genuine, represents a face
    like a dog’s—the most ill-favoured, ill-conditioned, repulsive face
    imaginable. Another, Alexander Hart, used his wonderful powers for
    finding lucky days for young gentlemen about to gamble. Lilly does
    not seem to have grasped the elementary fact that any one actually
    possessing magical powers would certainly use them for his own
    enrichment. And there was Captain Bubb, who “resolved horary questions
    astrologically.” He, however, was found out and put into pillory.
    There was one Jeffrey Neve, who brought Lilly two hundred “verified
    questions,” desiring him to correct them for publication, but of the
    first forty, thirty were untrue. There was Dr. Ardee, who declared that
    an angel had offered him a lease of life for one thousand years; yet
    the poor man died at fourscore.
  </p>

  <p>
    The crystal ball was not an astrological instrument, but many of the
    astrologers practised by means of it. This instrument of pretence and
    imposture has been revived in our own times. The ball was held in
    the hand by those who had “the sight.” Then things and persons were
    seen. Thus there was one Sarah Skelhorn who had a perfect “sight.” She
    could see in the ball what any persons were doing at any time or in
    any place, but seems to have used this remarkable gift for objects
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
    quite paltry, as when she observed her mother, who was many miles
    away, taking a red waistcoat out of a trunk—a really terrible waste of
    good power. How useful would Sarah be in time of war in order to tell
    exactly where the enemy was and what the enemy was doing! She was also
    familiar with angels, who were so fond of her that they followed her
    about until she was really tired of them.
  </p>

  <p>
    There was Ellen Evans, daughter of the scandalous <i xml:lang="fr">défroqué</i> above
    mentioned. She could call up the Queen of the Pigmies whenever she
    pleased merely by saying, “O Micol! O tu Micol, Regina Pygmeorum,
    veni!” There was also Sir Robert Holborn, Knight, who “formerly had
    sight and conference with Uriel and Raphael, but lost them both by
    carelessness.” And so on. The volume is redeemed from intolerable
    silliness by the firm belief of the author in the science. It shows,
    however, that the whole of the country was filled with credulity and
    childish superstition.
  </p>

  <p>
    The following lines are the commencement of a Latin epitaph composed
    for Lilly by one George Smalridge, student of Christ Church, Oxford:—

    Two official superstitions must be recorded, if only because they were
    practised and no doubt fully believed in London. They were touching for
    the King’s Evil and the blessing of the Cramp Ring. The ceremonies for
    both these observances are here described.
  </p>

  <p>First, the touching for the King’s Evil—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="lefthang">“<i>The King, kneeling, shall say</i>,</p>
    <p class="ml6">In the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.</p>

    <p class="lefthang"><i>And so soon as He hath said that, He shall say</i>,</p>
    <p class="ml6">Give the blessing.</p>

    <p class="lefthang"><i>The Chaplain, kneeling before the King, and having a Stole about
      his Neck, shall answer and say</i>,</p>
    <p class="ml6">
      The Lord be in your heart and in your lips, to confess all your
      sins. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
      Ghost. Amen.
    </p>

    <p class="lefthang"><i>Or else he shall say</i>,</p>
    <p class="ml6">
      Christ hear us. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of
      the Holy Ghost. Amen.
    </p>

    <p class="lefthang"><i>Then by and by the King shall say</i>,</p>
    <p class="ml6">
      I confess to God, to the blessed Virgin Mary, to all Saints, and
      to you, that I have sinned in thought, word, and deed through my
      fault; I pray Holy <i>Mary</i>, and all the saints of God and you, to
      pray for me.
    </p>

    <p class="lefthang"><i>The Chaplain shall answer and say</i>,</p>
    <p class="ml6">
      Almighty God have mercy upon you, and pardon you all your sins,
      deliver you from all evil, and confirm you in good, and bring you
      to everlasting life. Amen.
    </p>
    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span></p>
    <p class="ml6">
      The Almighty and Merciful Lord grant you absolution and remission
      of all your sins, time for true repentance and amendment of life,
      with the grace and comfort of his Holy Spirit. Amen.
    </p>

    <p class="lefthang"><i>This done the Chaplain shall say</i>,</p>
    <p class="ml6">The Lord be with you.</p>

    <p class="lefthang"><i>The King shall answer</i>,</p>
    <p class="ml6">And with thy spirit.</p>

    <p class="lefthang"><i>The Chaplain</i>,</p>
    <p class="ml6">Part of the Gospel according to St. Mark.</p>

    <p class="lefthang"><i>The King shall answer</i>,</p>
    <p class="ml6">Glory to thee, O Lord.</p>

    <p class="lefthang"><i>The Chaplain reads the Gospel</i>:</p>
    <p class="ml6">
      Last he appeared to those Eleven as they sat at the Table: and he
      exprobated their Incredulity and hardness of Heart, because they
      did not believe them that had seen him risen again. And he said
      to them: Going into the whole World, Preach the Gospel to all
      Creatures. He that believeth and is Baptised, shall be saved: But
      he that believeth not, shall be condemned. And them that believe,
      these Signs shall follow: In my name shall they cast out Devils,
      they shall speak with new tongues. Serpents shall they take up, and
      if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them; they shall
      impose hands upon the sick, and they shall be whole.
    </p>

    <p class="lefthang">
      <i>Which last clause</i> (They shall impose, etc.) <i>the Chaplain repeats

    <p class="lefthang"><i>The Chaplain then shall say this Gospel following</i>:</p>
    <p class="ml6">
      In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and God
      was the word. This was in the beginning with God. All things were
      made by him, and without him was made nothing that which was made.
      In him was life, and the life was the light of men. And the light
      shineth in darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it. There
      was a man sent from God, whose name was <i>John</i>. This man came for
      testimony: to give testimony of the light, that all might believe
      through him. He was not the light, but to give testimony of the
      light. It was the true light which lightneth every man that cometh
      into this world.
    </p>

    <p class="lefthang">
      <i>Which last Clause</i> (It was the true light, etc.) <i>shall still be
      repeated so long as the King shall be crossing the sore of the
      sick Person, with an Angel of Gold Noble, and the sick Person to
      have the same Angel hang’d about his neck, and to wear it until he
      be full whole. This done, the Chirurgion shall lead away the sick
      Person as he did before; and then the Chaplain shall make an end of
      the Gospel</i>:
    </p>
    <p class="ml6">
      He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world
      knew him not. He came into his own, and his own received him not.
      But as many as received him, he gave them power to be made the Sons
      of God, to those that believe in his name. Who not of blood, nor
      of will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God are born.
      And the word was made flesh and dwelt in us, and we saw the glory
      of him, glory as it were of the only begotten of the Father, full
      of grace and verity.

    Next, the blessing of the Cramp Ring by the King on Good Friday
    according to the form prescribed. It was as follows:—

      may be sensible and publish, that whatsoever is profitable to soule
      or body is derived from thee: through Christ our Lord. Amen.

  <p>
    Then with another prayer holy water was thrown on the rings and the

  <p class="noindent">
    <span class="smcap">There</span> is a somewhat dreary allegory of a voyage called “The Floating
    Island, or a New Discovery relating the Strange Adventure on a late
    Voyage from Lambethana to Villa Franca, <i xml:lang="la">alias</i> Ramallia, to the
    eastward of Terra del Templo.”
  </p>

  <p>
    It was published in the year 1673, and it contains an account of
    certain parts of London which give it some interest. The humour of the
    piece is that places described are mentioned as new discoveries lying
    at the distance of many days’ voyage from one to the other. Thus, to
    take a single example, the following is the description of the Savoy.
    The sanctuary of this quarter is, of course, Alsatia:—
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “The Palace is a very stately Fabrick, and hath been formerly
      employed for charitable uses, and still serves as an excellent
      Refuge and Sanctuary for such who are either forced by banishment,
      or voluntary Exile, to desert their native or long lov’d
      habitations, where they may live obscurely, and yet take their
      pleasure abroad in the Countries round about, by the means of those
      several convenient Avenues belonging thereunto, viz. for sporting
      on a brave River, the Stairs; for the Land, the Great Gate butting
      Norwards and separated but by a very small channel from Excestria.
      To the eastward there is an outlet which leadeth two ways, the one
      on the left into the Dutchy, the other turning a little on the
      right, into Somersetania; by the first you have a conveyance into
      the Country called Maypolia, and so have the whole Country before
      you to make choice of; by the last a safe passage by water, or a
      conduct short and commodious through the Provinces of White-Hart
      into Hortensia (vulgarly called Covent Garden), from whence you may
      travail through the whole kingdom.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Slavonian women supplied us with Fish and fruits of all sort,
      which they bring down in abundance from the Upland Countries;
      insomuch that we could not fear want of Provision so long as we had
      Money; nor question our security, whilst we did put ourselves under
      the Protection of this place or of the Dutchy Liberty.”
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    The sanctuary was for debtors, but not for felons or traitors, and
    bailiffs occasionally effected an entrance by pretending to have a
    warrant for the arrest of the latter. But on the cry of “Arrest,
    Arrest,” the whole of the residents flew to arms and drove out the
    offenders, perhaps with the loss of their ears. There were punishments
    inflicted on those who invaded the rights of sanctuary.
  </p>

  <p>
    Not far from the Savoy the adventurous voyagers discover a floating
    island, called the Summer Island, or Scoti Moria, viz. “There were two
    Ports or landing Places, one guarded by ‘Knights of the Blue Aprons,’”
    <i xml:lang="la">i.e.</i> waiters, who wore aprons of that colour; and the other by a
    woman with a white apron. They landed; they
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span> found, to leave the
    allegory, a company assembled playing skittles on the deck and down
    below drinking bad wine in worse company. The whole of the vessel was
    filled with bottles; and for commodities for sale or exchange there
    were none except “what were wrapped in silken Petticoats, and like a
    Pig in a Poke you must buy, or not at all.” There was also a billiard
    table on the ship, and tobacco was their only “breath and breathing
    while.” The next land they touch is the Island of Ursina, or the
    Bearbaiting, on which it appears that the charge of five shillings
    covered a ticket for drink as well as entrance. The description of the
    sport, which follows, affords nothing new. Sailing from Ursina, they
    arrive at the <i xml:lang="la">Ne plus ultra</i>, where they are deafened by the “great
    fall and hideous noise of the waters”—in other words, at London Bridge.
    Not far from this place they discovered mermaids, both male and female;
    but the latter only swam at night, being shy. I do not understand this
    allusion.
  </p>

  <p>
    The author is pleased to represent Terra del Templo, or the Temple, as
    a place occupied chiefly by a people constantly engaged in defending
    themselves against an enemy.
  </p>

  <blockquote>

    <p>
      “In the Description of this Ramallia, I must look into Terra del
      Templo, but shall not pry into its Court, nor any of the standing
      houses, the Housekeeper’s lodging, nor into the menial precincts of
      the Inns of Court, farther, than they stand for Refuge and Relief
      of the neighbouring Privileges about them. And indeed (since the
      general purgation by fire) the first, and chiefest of all, which
      for advantage of ground, for fortifications, for Water Works,
      Posterns, Passages, Supplies, and provisions by land, or otherwise,
      is that so far famed and so fitly named Ramallia; in it are several
      Garrisons of old Soldiers, every one of the which is able to lead a
      whole Army of Younger Debtors.
    </p>

    <p>
      They call their Muster rôle in the Round Church, which might more
      properly be called their Corps du Guard; then they draw them out
      into the Cloysters, and either exercise them there, or in the
      Garden, which is an excellent Military Spot for that purpose; but
      under the Blowers in the Rum Stampers (called the King’s Bench
      walk) they pitch their set Battles, where every evening that ground
      (which was lifted in and level’d for their use) is fil’d with men
      of desperate and undaunted resolution.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first work in Ramallia is rais’d and contrived in the form of
      a Ram; there is no other reason I can render for it, but that Rams
      were of great use in the Jewish Discipline, for Batteries, as you
      may read in Josephus his History more at large. This work is of
      reasonable strength; in former times it had a watch Tower in the
      similitude of a Coblers shop adjoyning, from whence all the forces
      about are called together, upon the least approach of the Enemy.
      There is another, called the Maidenhead, and is impregnable, where
      the Enemy dares not come within shot, and in the nearest to the
      confines of Terra del Templo. There are other pretty contrived
      Platforms, as Teste Royal, the Falcon, Mitre, etc., and these in
      the fashion and form of Cookshops; where if a Setter or Spy chance
      to peep in at them (though very dark) they will make him pay for
      the roast before he depart. To this Ramallia, or Ramykins, belongs
      a very great Fleet, consisting of many Sail, well man’d, and are a
      great preservation to the Ramykins.
    </p>

    <p>
      This place, according to the late Geographical Map, as well as
      the report of ancient Writers, cannot possibly be so besieged but
      that they within may go in and out at their pleasure, without
      impeachment; for at the Middle Temple Gate they issue in spight of
      the Devil; at the Inner Temple Gate they fear no colours in the
      Rainbow; and at the Postern of the Ramykins, in case they cannot
      make over to Fetter Lane, but discover Ambuscado’s, they need only
      draw their bodies within guard of Pike, turn faces about, and
      retreat through the Mitre.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now admit they stand for Rio del Plata (commonly called Fleet
      Street) and be so intercepted that
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>they cannot recover the
      Ramykins, all that is required in that case is but to mend their
      March; fall downwards, as if they gave way, suddenly discharge
      their right-hand file, and fall easily into Sergeants Inn; where by
      ancient Treaty had between this famous place and Terra del Templo,
      it was agreed that the parties in such distress might (paying a
      small Fee) have convoy and conveyance without the re-hazzard of any
      of their persons.
    </p>

    <p>
      If at any time they had a mind to Forrage, they are no sooner out
      of the Middle Temple Gate, but there is a threefold way to defend
      them; the Bell Inn, the Bar Gate, and Shire Lane. The passage under
      the Blowers is a most excellent safe way for close contriving
      and retriving; neither is the Gardners Wharfage (as the Tide may
      serve) anyways inconsiderable. To speak the truth, the nature of
      Ramallia is much alter’d in few years, neither is the place so much
      frequented as formerly by Forreigners in Refuge, the inhabitants
      slighting or being careless in the preservation of their ancient
      privileges.”

    The author tells us, further, that there were formerly many other
    places which were considered sanctuaries for debtors, <i xml:lang="la">i.e.</i> places
    where writs could not be served. These were (1) Milford Lane, at first
    occupied and defended by indigent officers, who held it, so to speak,
    by the sword:—
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “And notwithstanding their title hath been much disputed
      heretofore, yet they have now commuted the matter, prov’d
      Plantation, and have withal reduced it to a most absolute Hance and
      free Town of itself, without dependency.”

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span></p>

  <p>
    (2) Fulwoods Rents in Holborn, a place which remained to this century
    of bad reputation, though it contained several good houses.<a id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
  </p>

  <p>(3) Baldwin’s Gardens was another sanctuary:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “The Back-gate into Graies-Inn Lane, with the benefit of Bauldwins
      Gardens, is of excellent use; but the passiges through certain
      Inns on the Field-side are not attempted without hazard, by reason
      of the straggling Troops of the Enemy, who lie Purdue in every
      ale-house thereabouts. The safest way of Sally is that through the
      Walks, from whence the Red Lyon in Graies-Inn Lane receives them
      with good quartering, and passes them through the back way into the
      Main Land.”
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>(4) Another was Great St. Bartholomew’s:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “Upon whose platform a whole Army of Borrowers and Book-men might
      have been mustred and drawn out in length, or into what form or
      figure it had pleased them to cast themselves. What works, yea what
      variety of Art and Workmanship was within it; What an excellent
      half-Moon was there cast up without it, for defence to the
      Eastward; What excellent Sconces, in the fashion of Tobacco-shops
      and Ale houses in all parts of it.
    </p>

    <p>
      But alas these are demolisht, for the most part, the old Soldiers
      discharg’d, and all delivered up into the hand of the Enemy upon
      composition.”
    </p>

    The precinct of St. John of Jerusalem was also formerly held as a
    sanctuary, but had lost its privileges. In the precinct of Blackfriars
    privileges were granted to some of the oldest trades, those, probably,
    which were carried on in the few houses belonging to the Friars. These
    were feathermakers, Scotch tailors, and French shoemakers. Another is
    Montagu Close, on the west side of St. Mary Overies, the sanctuary of
    the Borough. In later years it was removed further south to the place
    called the Mint.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the north side of Blackfriars is the place which the residents of
    all these sanctuaries are continually trying to escape. The author
    calls it a very strong and formidable citadel belonging to the enemy.
    This is Ludgate Prison.

    <p>
      “It is much like the apples of Sodom, better for fight without
      than in. Its whole prospect from within are iron grates, where,
      through every Transom, the forlorn Captives may take a view of
      the Iron Age; there is one single entrance, which, like Hell’s
      Gate, lets many in, but few out, turn once the Ward—Et vestigia
      nulla retrorsum. The Cimmerians in their dwellings resemble these
      in their lodgings, only their lights are different; those receive
      some scattered beamings by their Mountain Crannies; these by their
      disconsolate loopholes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Yet from above, the Inhabitants may take a view of all those places
      which club’d to their restrain; and be reminded of the loss of time
      which brought them thither. The Governour hereof is careless whence
      they come, but infinitely cautious how they go away; and if they go
      away without his favour, they are in great danger to break their
      necks for their labour.”

    The rest of the little book is made up of a Rabelaisian description
    of the people in sanctuary—the Ram Alley folk, with certain “special
    cases.”

      fellows and constant Companions have but one shirt between them,
      and that these three (seeing none of their other shifts will do
      them any good) jointly consent this shirt shall be sold, it shall
      be lawful for them to expose it to sale, vended and condemned for
      the common good of three, and that forthwith the money be spent
      in the cherishing that blood that retired from the extream parts,
      being chil’d with the fright of parting with so dear and near a
      friend.”

    <span class="smcap">In</span> this chapter I have collected certain notes which may illustrate
    such points in City government as differentiate the seventeenth century
    from that which preceded and that which followed it. For instance, the
    times were troubled; a man might, by bending before the successive
    storms, win his way through in safety; but an honest man with
    principles, courage, and convictions might expect fine and imprisonment
    if he accepted office, and might think himself lucky if he carried his
    ears out of office, or if he were not fined to the full extent of his
    worldly fortune, or if he had not to fly across the seas to Holland. In
    <cite>Remembrancia</cite>, therefore, we are not surprised to find many letters
    from merchants praying to be excused from office.
  </p>

  <p>
    Among the less dangerous duties of the Mayor was the reception of the
    foreign Ambassadors.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the arrival of Ambassadors the Lords of the Council sent a letter
    to the Lord Mayor commanding him to find a suitable residence and
    a proper reception. In 1580 the Spanish Ambassador was allotted a
    house in Fenchurch Street which he did not like, so he asked instead
    for Arundel House. In 1583 the Swedish Ambassador arrived; he was to
    have three several lodgings, with stabling for twenty horses. In 1613
    the “Emperor of Muscovy” sent an Ambassador; in 1611 one came from
    the Duke of Savoy; in 1616 an Ambassador-Extraordinary arrived from
    the King of France; in 1626 two from the State of Venice; in 1628
    another Spanish Ambassador; in the same year a Russian Ambassador; in
    1637 an Ambassador from the “King of Morocco.” All these Ambassadors
    were lodged and entertained in the City after a formal reception and
    procession through the streets to their lodging.
  </p>

  <p>
    Mediæval London was a city of palaces and of nobles’ palaces. Under the
    Tudors there were still some of these town houses left. Toward the end
    of the seventeenth century there were very few, only one or two.
  </p>

  <p>
    A long list of noblemen and gentlemen living around London in the
    year 1673 may be found in the <cite>London and Middlesex Note-book</cite>. When
    one examines<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
    this list a little closely, it is remarked that the
    residences of far the greater number of those on the list are at St.
    Martin’s-in-the-Fields, at Westminster, in St. James’s Fields, in
    Leicester Fields, at Hackney, and that, though some actually belong to
    the outskirts of the City, none are living within the walls of the City
    itself except the City knights and merchants.

    <div class="caption">
      WARWICK HOUSE, CLOTH FAIR
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    The houses still occupied by nobility, taking them from Ogilby’s Map
    (see <a href="#i_400fp">Map</a>) were: Thanet House in Aldersgate Street, the town house of
    the Earl of Thanet; the Earl of Bridgwater’s house in the Barbican;
    Warwick House; Brook House and Ely House, in Holborn; Lord Berkeley’s
    house in St. John Street; the Marquis of Dorchester’s, Lord Grey’s,
    and the Earl of Ailesbury’s in Charter-house Lane; in the Strand,
    Somerset House, belonging to, or occupied by successively, Queen
    Anne of Denmark, Queen Henrietta Maria, Queen Catherine of Braganza;
    Arundel House, then the residence of the Duke of Norfolk, who was a
    great collector of statues and inscriptions; Essex House, where Robert
    Devereux, Earl of Essex, the parliamentary general, was born. All
    these three were in the Strand. Outside Ogilby’s Map, but still in the
    outskirts of the City, were Lord Craven’s and Lord Clare’s houses, in
    and near Drury Lane.
  </p>

  <p>
    If we take one parish for an example—say that of St. Benet’s, Thames
    Street—we find that the son of the Earl of Carnarvon was christened
    in that church on November 26, 1633, that four children of the Earl
    of Pembroke were born in this parish and christened in this church,
    viz. Susanna, christened May 7, 1650; Mary, December 12, 1651; Philip,
    January 5, 1652; and Rebecca, July 18, 1655.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before the Fire these noblemen had town houses in the parish—Lord
    Pembroke had Baynard’s Castle; their chaplains died in those town
    houses and lie buried in the church. Derby House, now the College of
    Heralds, was also in this parish, as was also Huntingdon House, the
    residence of Lord Hastings.
  </p>

  <p>
    The departure of the nobility from their City houses was perhaps one
    cause of the cessation of the old connection of the country gentry
    with the City. This departure also contributed to a very important
    social change, viz. the fact that for a long time, now more than two
    centuries, the Mayor, the Aldermen, the City officers, and the City
    merchants have been socially and politically entirely out of touch
    with the nobility. In the next century some of the effects of this
    separation were greatly to be lamented. The seventeenth century,
    however, furnishes one very remarkable illustration of the connection
    between the City and the country gentry.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span> It is also an illustration
    of the way in which middle-class families went up and down. Early in
    the seventeenth century, one Pepys, a country gentleman of no great
    standing, married a girl of his own class whose sister married into
    the Montagu family. One of his sons, a younger son, was sent to London
    and entered into trade, but without conspicuous success. He became a
    tailor, and he was of course first cousin to Sir Edward Montagu, his
    mother’s nephew. One of his sons succeeded him in the business, the
    other became Secretary of the Admiralty, and afterwards President of
    the Royal Society; he is also the writer of the finest diary ever
    committed to paper. Sir Edward Montagu became Lord Sandwich. In his
    family there were therefore, all closely connected, Lord Sandwich, the
    Chief Justice of Ireland, a Doctor of Divinity, a Member of Parliament,
    the Secretary of the Admiralty, a serjeant-at-law, a hosteller, a
    publican, a tobacconist, a butcher, a tailor, a weaver, a goldsmith,
    and a turner. As yet, however, the rest of the <cite>Note-book</cite> before us
    shows a great number of persons in the City who had the right to call
    themselves “Gentlemen” at a time when the title could not be assumed by
    any who chose, and was not conferred lightly or at haphazard. Social
    distinctions were much more strongly marked then than now. Although
    the City contained no noble lords, it had Baronets, Knights, Esquires,
    and Gentlemen. The Esquires were gentlemen of good estate, dignified
    councillors at law, physicians, and holders of the King’s Commission,
    holders of offices of importance. The eldest son of a Knight was an
    Esquire by right; the eldest son of a Sheriff was also entitled to this
    distinction. Pepys, when he received the appointment of Secretary to
    the Admiralty, is addressed for the first time in his life, and greatly
    to his delight, as Esquire. The title of Gentleman was more widely
    claimed; the son of a gentleman was also a gentleman. A younger son,
    however, could not call himself, or be called Esquire unless he had
    some other qualification. It is not at all uncommon to find the word
    “Gentleman” on a title-page after the name of the author. There are
    complaints as to the illegal use of the title. The rank of gentleman
    was conceded to attorneys, proctors, and notaries; but merchants,
    however wealthy, artists, authors, surgeons, and tradesmen could obtain
    no recognition of gentility on account of the nature of their work,
    though by descent they might be gentlemen.

    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
    The <cite>Visitation of London</cite> (1633–1635), published in 1880 by the
    Harleian Society, contains the genealogies and shields of over 900
    City families. If we assume that these shields were honestly examined
    and allowed, we have the very remarkable fact that in the seventeenth
    century there were 900 City families within the walls of the City who
    were descended from the country gentry, and had preserved proof of
    their descent. The trade or calling of those whose names are given
    in the genealogy does not always appear; the great majority seem to
    be in trade of some kind. Thus we find Goldsmith, Draper, Grocer,
    Fishmonger, Haberdasher, Mercer, Gentleman, Skinner, “of the Temple,”
    Doctor of Physic, Merchant Tailor, Merchant, Doctor of Divinity,
    Vintner, Barber, Surgeon, “of Clifford’s Inn,” Attorney in the office
    of the Pleas on the Exchequer Court, Cordwayner, “Searcher and Trier
    and Sealer of Madder,” Dyer, Scryvener, Sadler, “Silman to Prince
    Charles,” Merchant of the Staple, “One of His Majesty’s Auditors,”
    “One of the Commissioners for the Royal Navy,” “Surveyor of Customs,”
    Joyner, Stationer, Brewer, etc. Here are enough to show that every
    kind of trade was represented, but not every kind of craft. It is rare
    to find a craft at all, and then the person concerned was evidently
    an employer of working-men, a master craftsman. The names themselves
    have quite lost the mediæval aspect which they presented in the wills
    and memorials. There is hardly a name which might not belong to the
    London Directory of the present year. The name of Pepys is among them,
    but not that of Samuel, who was not yet born. “Yet I never thought we
    were of much account,” he said thirty years afterwards. The family
    came from South Creake, in the county of Norfolk. The name of Milton
    is there, with a confusion of Mitton and Milton, but not the name of
    John. As for the origin of these families, it was from every part of
    the country. It is, however, noticeable that, whereas in the fourteenth
    century the names of Mayor and Sheriffs in office were frequently—nay,
    generally—those of men who came up from their fathers’ manors young, in
    these lists most of them are London citizens of the second, third, and
    fourth generations.

    Referring to the lists in the “Stow” of 1633, the following Mayors have
    marks of cadency on their arms. The arms, therefore, are not newly
    granted but hereditary:—
  </p>

  <blockquote>

    <p>
      “Adam Bamme, 1390.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ermine, on a chief indented, sable, two
      trefoils, argent: an annulet for difference, being the mark of
      cadency for a fifth son.
    </p>

    <p>John Froyshe, 1394.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fess engrailed: an annulet.</p>

    <p>
      [Sir Thomas] Mirfine, 1518.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Argent, a chevron sable: a mullet, and

    The freedom from taxation of certain privileged classes was a fruitful
    cause of quarrel and annoyance. Barristers who lived in the Four Inns
    of Court and in Serjeant’s Inn were exempt from taxation on account
    of chambers. The same privilege was extended to residents in Doctors’
    Commons and residents in the precincts of Blackfriars and Whitefriars,
    who were also exempt from fifteenths and from the burdens of watch
    and ward, except charges for defence of the State, for pavement and
    clearing within the precinct, and except freemen of the City, who
    continued to be liable to the City charges.

  <p>
    A City office long discontinued was that of Chronologer. In the
    <cite>Analytical Index to Remembrancia</cite> (Guildhall) we have the following
    notes:—
  </p>

  <p>
    It may not be considered uninteresting to give a list of the names of
    the different holders of this peculiar office, some of whom, as Thomas
    Middleton, Ben Johnson, and Francis Quarles, are otherwise known to
    fame, with some few particulars from the Civic Records concerning them.
  </p>

  <p>
    1620, September 6, 18th James I.—Thomas Middleton, admitted City
    Chronologer. Item, this day was read in Court (of Aldermen) a
    petition of Thomas Middleton, Gent., and upon consideration thereof
    taken, and upon the sufficient testimony this Court hath received of
    his services performed to this City, this Court is well pleased to
    entertain and admit the said Thomas Middleton to collect and set down
    all memorable acts of this City and occurrences thereof, and for such
    other employments as this Court shall have occasion to use him in;
    but the said Thomas Middleton is not to put any of the acts so by him
    to be collected into print without the allowance and approbation of
    this Court, and for the readiness of his service to the City in the
    same employments this Court does order that he shall receive from
    henceforth, out of the Chamber of London, a yearly fee of £6:13:4.
  </p>

  <p>1620, November 20, 18th James I.—His salary increased to £10 per annum.</p>

  <p>
    1621, April 17, 19th James I.—A freedom granted to Thomas Middleton,
    Chronologer and inventor of honourable entertainments for this City,
    towards his expenses.
  </p>

  <p>
    1622, May 7, 20th James I.—Another freedom granted to him for his
    better encouragement in his labours.
  </p>

  <p>1622, September 17, 20th James I.—£15 granted to him for the like.</p>

  <p>1622 (3), February 6, 20th James I.—£20 granted to him.</p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span></p>

  <p>1623, April 24, 21st James I.—One freedom granted to him.</p>

  <p>
    1623, September 2, 21st James I.—Twenty marks given him for his
    services at the shooting on Bunhill and at the Conduit Head before the
    Lord Mayor and Aldermen.
  </p>

  <p>
    1627, February 7, 3rd Charles I.—Twenty nobles given to his widow
    Magdalen.

    1628, September 2, 4th Charles I.—Item, this day Benjamin Johnson,
    Gent., is by this Court admitted to be the City’s Chronologer in place
    of Mr. Thomas Middleton, deceased, to have, hold, exercise, and enjoy
    the same place, and to have and receive for that his service, out of
    the Chamber of London, the sum of one hundred nobles per annum, to
    continue during the pleasure of this Court.
  </p>

  <p>
    1631, November 2, 7th Charles I.—Item, it is ordered by this Court
    that Mr. Chamberlain shall forbear to pay any more fee or wages unto
    Benjamin Johnson, the City’s Chronologer, until we shall have presented
    unto this Court some fruits of his labours in that his place.
  </p>

  <p>
    1634, September 18, 10th Charles I.—Item, this day Mr. Recorder and
    Sir (Hugh) Hamersley, Knight, Alderman, declared unto this Court
    His Majesty’s pleasure, signified unto them by the Right Hon. the
    Earl of Dorset, for and in the behalf of Benjamin Johnson, the City
    Chronologer, whereupon it is ordered by this Court that his yearly
    pension of 100 nobles out of the Chamber of London shall be continued,
    and that Mr. Chamberlain shall satisfy and pay unto him all arrearages
    thereof.
  </p>

  <p>
    1639, February 1, 15th Charles I.—At the request of the Right Hon. the
    Earl of Dorset, signified by his letter, Francis Quarles, Gent., was
    admitted Chronologer. with a fee of 100 nobles per annum, during the
    pleasure of the Court.
  </p>

  <p>
    1645, October 1, 20th Charles I.—Walter Frost, Esq., Sword-bearer,
    admitted Chronologer, so long as he shall well demean himself therein
    and present yearly something of his labours.
  </p>

  <p>
    1660, February 28, 13th Charles II.—Captain John Burroughs admitted
    City Chronologer, the place having been void for several years, his
    salary to be 100 nobles per annum.
  </p>

  <p>
    1668, November 23, 20th Charles II.—Upon the recommendation of a
    Committee, the yearly payment of 100 nobles to one Bradshaw, called the
    City Chronologer, was discontinued with the place, there appearing no
    occasion for such an officer.
  </p>

  <p>
    1669, February 24, 22nd Charles II.—On the petition of Cornewall
    Bradshaw, Gent., late City Chronologer, for some recompense for his
    salary of £33:6:8, taken from him by vote of the Court (Common
    Council), it was ordered that, upon his resigning his said place, the
    Chamberlain should pay him £100 in full of all claims.
  </p>

  <p>
    1669, March 17, 22nd Charles II.—Bradshaw (admitted in the Mayoralty of
    Sir T. Bludworth, 1665–6, as City Chronologer) surrendered his office,
    with all its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
    rights, etc., and a freedom was given to him (<cite>Index to
    Remembrancia</cite>, pp. 305, 306).
  </p>

  <p>
    Between 1583 and 1661 there were continual efforts made to restrain the
    building of new houses in the City and the erection of small tenements.
    The Lords of the Council pressed on the Mayor the duty of enforcing
    the laws. The Mayor replied that there were many places in the City
    that pretended to be exempt from the jurisdiction of the City; notably
    the sites of the old monasteries. One result of this activity was the
    driving of the poorer sort outside the City Liberties altogether,
    especially along the river side. Owing to this cause Southwark began
    to enjoy an influx of the least desirable of the population. This
    distinction the Borough has ever since continued to possess. The same
    cause built the courts and created the slums of Westminster.

  <p>
    The attempt to restrain the increase of London should have been
    accompanied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
    by an enlargement of the City jurisdiction. Had this been
    done, many of the evils attendant on a rapid growth of population with
    no corresponding powers of justice and police might have been avoided.
  </p>

  <p>
    The necessity of cleaning and keeping clean the streets was very much
    to the front after the scare of the Plague and the Fire. There were
    projects advanced by ingenious persons for this purpose. Thus one
    Daniel Nis laid a plan before the King, who sent it on to the Lord
    Mayor for consideration. He wanted, apparently, to raise the footpath
    on either side to a “convenient height, evenness, and decency, leaving
    ample passage for coaches, carts, and horses, and reserving a competent
    part to be made even and easy in a far more elegant and commodious
    manner for the convenience of foot passengers, besides a handsome
    accommodation of water for the continual cleansing of the streets by
    lead pipes.”

    Daniel Nis was before his age, but one feels that when such projects
    are in the air, reform and improvement are at hand. Unfortunately
    projectors of this kind never understand the practical side of the
    question. Now the streets of a great city cannot be revolutionised all
    at once; no city is rich enough to undertake such a reform; the only
    thing possible is a gradual reform, taking the most important streets
    first. And this, in fact, was the way adopted in the City and carried
    on from the Great Fire to our own time.
  </p>

  <p>
    If we go into the unreformed streets we find the kites and crows
    still acting as the principal scavengers, the bye-streets unpaved and
    unlighted—that is to say, not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
    yet even paved with cobbles, but left
    quite untouched with puddles of liquid filth standing about; there were
    also masterless dogs by the hundred who devoured the offal.
  </p>

  <p>
    The regulations for the standing of carts were of very early date.
    Standings were fixed in Tower Street and on Tower Hill in 1479. It must
    be remembered that most of the streets in the City were too narrow for
    the passage of wheeled vehicles; it was therefore necessary to regulate
    the traffic in the streets wide enough for carts to pass. Such Acts
    were passed and altered in 1586, 1605, 1654, 1658, 1661, 1665, 1667,
    and 1681. The last Act for licensing and regulating carts was passed
    in 1838. The Woodmongers’ Company at one time had the management of
    the carts. In 1605, when Christ’s Hospital had charge of the carts, a
    single cart was taxed 13s. 4d. a year, together with 4s. for quarterage
    and no more. The whole number of carts allowed was 400, viz. 100 for
    Southwark, 200 in the skirts of the City, and 100 in the wood wharves.
  </p>

  <p>
    The watchmen carried bells, not rattles; they rang them as they went
    along to announce their coming; the thieves in this way secured timely
    warning and got themselves into safe hiding. But Cosmo, Duke of
    Tuscany, who came here in 1669, says that the streets were orderly,
    well lit by lanterns, and that the citizens were not afraid to go about
    without swords.
  </p>

  <p>
    Such squares as then existed, as Lincoln’s Inn Fields, had taken the
    place of Smithfield as a place of public resort. They were now laid
    out in three separate fields; these were surrounded by mulberry-trees.
    It was a common complaint that in summer evenings after work was over
    ballad singers stationed themselves at every street corner and bawled
    their songs to an admiring and a listening crowd, that their songs were
    coarse and lewd—perhaps it is the Puritan minister who complains,—and
    that young girls stood among the audience listening and laughing.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 1618 the chimney-sweepers sent a petition to Sir Robert Naunton
    stating that householders generally neglected to get their chimneys
    swept, to the great danger of fire and the starvation of their kind,
    200 in number; and they prayed that the citizens might be compelled to
    have their chimneys swept at proper times, and that an overseer should
    be appointed to look after this duty. The Lord Mayor reported that it
    was unnecessary to appoint another overseer, because there were already
    officers annually sworn to inspect chimneys. So nothing more is heard
    of the chimney-sweep and his grievances.
  </p>

  <p>
    The subject of the City laystalls is unsavoury. But the removal of
    waste matter is always a trouble in every town. In 1670 orders were
    made for laystalls to be established at various points. It must be
    understood that all kinds of rubbish, ordure, decaying vegetables,
    etc., were shot out upon the laystall; when it was near the river the
    contents were from time to time shovelled out into the ebb tide. The
    following is the list of the laystalls as appointed in 1670:—

    The Radical root-and-branch reformer is not unknown in every age. I
    have before me a pamphlet written by such an one in the year 1675. It
    will be seen that he advocates a thorough reform or rather a return to
    the former conditions. I quote a portion only of the pamphlet. Among
    other things the writer proposes—
  </p>

  <p>
    (1) That a stop be put to any new buildings in London, or within the
    bills of mortality.
  </p>

  <p>
    (2) That the nobility and gentry of the country be compelled to reside
    so many months in the year on their estates.
  </p>

  <p>
    (3) That brandy, music, coffee, and tea be prohibited, and
    coffee-houses suppressed.
  </p>

  <p>
    (4) That the multitude of stage coaches and caravans now on the roads
    be all, or most of them, suppressed.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span></p>

  <p>
    (5) That a Court of Conscience should be established in Westminster and
    in every important town.
  </p>

  <p>
    (6) That the extravagant wages of craftsmen should be reduced. The
    writer proceeds to advance his reasons for these proposals. For
    instance, the abundance of new houses tempts people to come up from the
    country in order to establish ale or brandy shops or to let lodgings;
    it also tempts the gentry to leave their estates and to live in London.
  </p>

  <p>
    As to the prohibition of brandy, it is stated that brandy was so cheap,
    a quartern being sold for threepence, that the people drink spirits
    instead of strong beer and ale. (This is the first complaint of spirit
    drinking.) Whereas, if the sale of brandy were prohibited, there would
    be so great an increase in the consumption of barley required for beer
    that the farmers would rise from their impoverished condition and be
    once more able to pay their rents. “Brandy,” he says, “burns out the
    hearts of his Majesty’s subjects.” It is not generally understood, I
    think, that there were complaints on the subject of brandy before the
    introduction of its cheaper and more destructive rival—gin.
  </p>

  <p>
    He would suppress tea, coffee, and chocolate for the simple reason
    that he does not understand that they do any good to anybody, and he
    would shut the coffee-houses because he believes them to be mischievous
    places:—
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “And for coffee, tea, and chocolate, I know no good they do; only
      the places where they are sold are convenient for persons to meet
      in, sit half a day, and discourse with all companies that come
      in, of state-matters, talking of news, and broaching of lies;
      arraigning the judgments and discretions of their own governors,
      censuring all their actions, and insinuating into the people a
      prejudice against them; extolling and magnifying their own parts,
      knowledge, and wisdom, and decrying that of their rulers, which, if
      suffered too long, may prove pernicious and destructive. But say
      there was nothing of this in the case, yet have these coffee-houses
      done great mischiefs to the nation, and undone many of the king’s
      subjects; for they, being very great enemies to diligence and
      industry, have been the ruin of many serious and hopeful young
      gentlemen and tradesmen, who, before they frequented these places,
      were diligent students or shopkeepers, extraordinary husbands of
      their time as well as money” (see also <a href="#Page_292">p. 292</a>).
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Granted a case against tea and coffee, what can be said against the
    stage coach? A great deal. Stage coaches destroy the breed of good
    horses, make men careless of horsemanship, and make them effeminate and
    afraid of cold, rain, and snow (for further on this subject see <a href="#Page_338">p. 338</a>).
  </p>

  <p>
    The crime of crimping—that is, inveigling or forcing young fellows
    to enter into service in the plantations—became very common in this
    century. It caused trouble in many ways. First, a man was encouraged
    to get drunk, and on recovering was told that he had enlisted, or he
    was knocked on the head and carried aboard, or he voluntarily enlisted
    and afterwards repented. In all these cases the victims complained on
    reaching Virginia that they had been betrayed or trapped, and they sent
    home sworn statements, with instructions to their friends, to indict
    the merchants for crimping and ensnaring them.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span></p>

  <p>
    These complaints became so numerous that rules were laid down for
    the enrolment of these servants, and if the rules were obeyed, the
    merchants were assured that there should be no prosecution:—
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “I. Such servants as are to be taken by Indenture, to be executed
      by the servant, in the presence of the magistrate or magistrates
      hereafter appointed: one part thereof signed by such servant, and
      also underwritten or endorsed with the name and handwriting of such
      magistrate, which is to remain with the clerk of the Peace to be
      renewed to the next sessions, there to be filed upon a distinct
      file, and numbered and kept with the records.
    </p>

    <p>
      II. The Clerk of the Peace is to keep a fair book, wherein the name
      of the person so bound, and the magistrate’s name before whom the
      same was done, and the time and place of doing thereof, and the
      number of the file shall be entred; and for the more easie finding
      the same, the entris are to be made alphabetically, according to
      the first letter of the sirname.
    </p>

    <p>
      III. All persons above the age of one and twenty years, or who
      shall, upon view and examination, appear to be so in the judgment
      of the magistrate, may be bound in the presence of one Justice of
      the Peace, or of the Mayor or chief Magistrate of the place where
      they shall go on shipboard, who is to be fully satisfied from him
      of his free and voluntary agreement to enter into the said service.
    </p>

    <p>
      IV. If any person be under the age of one and twenty years, or
      shall appear to be so, he shall be bound in the presence of the
      Lord Mayor of London, or one of the Judges, or an Alderman of
      London, being a Justice of the Peace, or the Recorder, or two
      Justices of the Peace of any other county or place, who shall
      carefully examine whether the person so to be bound have any
      parents or masters; and if he be not free they are not to take
      such indenture, unless the parents or masters give their consents,
      and some person that knows the said servant to be of the name and
      addition mentioned in the indenture is to assist his said knowledge
      upon the said indenture.
    </p>

    <p>
      V. If the person be under the age of fourteen years, unless his
      parents shall be present, and consent, he is not to be carried on
      shipboard till a fortnight at least after he becomes bound, to the
      intent that if there be any abuse, it may be discovered before he
      is transported. And where his parents do not appear before the
      magistrate, notice is to be sent to them; or where they cannot be
      found, to the churchwardens, overseers of the parish where he was
      last settled, in such manner as the said magistrates shall think
      fit and direct.
    </p>

    <p>
      And because Clerks of the Peace may conceive this not to be
      any part of the duty of their office, and may therefore exact
      unreasonable rewards for their trouble and pains therein, his
      Majesty doth declare that if any merchants or other persons shall
      be aggrieved thereby, and upon complaint to the Justices cannot
      obtain relief, his Majesty will take such further care for their
      ease herein, as in his royal wisdom he shall think meet.
    </p>

    <p>
      And his Majestie’s further pleasure is, that this order be printed
      and published, to the end all persons whom it may concern may take
      notice thereof, and govern themselves accordingly.”
    </p>
  </blockquote>

    Here is a very curious note concerning a custom long since forgotten.
    Before the discovery and importation of Indian nitre, saltpetre was
    manufactured from animal matter. This stuff was piled in heaps,
    protected from rain, and watered with stable runnings. Men called
    saltpetre-men were employed in collecting earth thus impregnated,
    and were by Act of Parliament (1624) authorised to dig up the floors
    of stables and any other places where this saturated earth might be
    found. So important was the manufacture that no dove-house or stable
    was permitted to be paved. The appearance of the saltpetre-man and his
    asserted right of digging up and carrying off the earth under stables
    became a grievance, against which remonstrance
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>was in vain so long
    as the civil wars lasted. In 1656, however, it was enacted that no
    saltpetre-man should dig without permission of the householder.
  </p>

  <p>
    During the seventeenth century the ’prentices, as we have seen,
    became of greater importance than ever; in the eighteenth their power
    declined. For instance, when in 1643 it was feared that Charles would
    march on the City, the ’prentices turned out in great force to fortify
    the entrances and roads all round the City. Four years later they
    turned out on strike, meeting in Covent Garden, then an open space, in
    order to compel their masters to give them back the old holidays of
    which the Puritans had deprived them. These were especially Christmas,
    with its days of merriment and minstrelsy, Good Friday, Easter Monday,
    and, I think, Whit Monday. Perhaps the Puritans had also deprived them
    of Queen Elizabeth’s Day. On Shrove Tuesday the ’prentices demolished,
    if they could find any, houses of ill fame. Their keepers were locked
    up in prison during the whole of Lent. This zeal for virtue on the part
    of the London ’prentice becomes a thing of suspicion when one reads
    <cite>The English Rogue</cite>. Perhaps it was a custom ordered and maintained
    by the masters. I conclude this chapter with the history of one of
    them. It will be seen that the lot of a ’prentice was not always the
    happiest or the most desirable. The following notes are taken from
    the autobiography of one of them, a scrivener’s printer, named F.
    K. To begin with, he was very fond of reading. While he was still a
    boy he read <cite>The Friar and the Boy</cite>, <cite>The Seven Wise men of Rome</cite>,
    <cite>Fortunatus</cite>, <cite>Doctor Faustus</cite>, <cite>Friar Bacon</cite>,
    <cite>Montelion Knight of the Oracle</cite>, <cite>Parismus</cite>,
    <cite>Palmerin of England</cite>, <cite>Amadis de Gaul</cite>. The
    boy procured the latter in French, and for the sake of reading it,
    taught himself French, and made a French dictionary for himself. As
    he could not afford to buy paper, he cut pages from the middle of the
    other boys’ copybooks, and, being found out, received a very sound and
    well-deserved flogging.
  </p>

  <p>
    When he was sixteen he was apprenticed to a scrivener for eight years’
    servitude, his father paying £30 and giving a bond for £100 as a
    guarantee of the boy’s honesty.
  </p>

  <p>
    His master had already two apprentices. It was the custom that the
    youngest apprentice should do, so to speak, the dirty work; but in this
    case the master had a son who was shortly afterwards apprenticed, and
    should, in his turn, have taken the lowest place; but by right of his
    position in the family he was spared this ignominy, and so the writer
    continued the drudge of the whole household as long as he remained in
    the house. Apart from his work in the shop, where he had to write out
    deeds, conveyances, etc.,—the scrivener’s profession exercising much
    the same functions as those now undertaken by the solicitor,—he says,
    “I was to make clean the Shooes, carry out the Ashes and Dust, sweep
    the Shop, cleanse the Sink, (and a long nasty one it was), draw the
    Beer, at washing times to fetch up Coals and Kettles; these were the
    within doors employs, and abroad I was to go of all
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span> errands, and carry
    all burthens. I dispensed with all these matters, being told thereof
    by my Father and Mother before I came, wherefore I was content, and
    did undergo all very willingly, till I had served about three years,
    and then being grown up to some maturity and understanding, I began to
    grumble. I had Money given me which I always laid out in purchasing of
    Books, especially such as treated of Knight Errantry, or else in buying
    somewhat to make me fine, and Money coming in pretty plentiful, I had
    bought me a very good Suit of Cloaths to wear by the by; and withal,
    being desirous to appear in everything like a gentleman, I had a Watch
    for my Pocket; being thus accoutred, I sometimes went abroad with our
    Neighbour Apprentices and others, and being thus fine, it troubled me
    that I must still carry Burthens, for whoever went empty, my Mistress
    would still take care that I had my Load to carry Working-day and
    Sunday from our London to our Countrey-house, and rather than I should
    want a Burthen, I was to carry earthen Pots and Pans and Ox Livers, and
    Bones for the Dog. This I grumbled at, and when I have bin seriously
    a drawing Writings in the Shop and studying and contriving how to
    order my Covenants the best way, a greasy Kitchin-wench would come and
    disturb me with one of her Errants, and tell me I must fetch a farthing
    worth of Mustard, or a pint of Vinegar, or some such mechanical story;
    nay, my Mistress hath sent me for a Pint of Purl, which when she hath
    warmed and tasted of, and not liked, I must carry it again to change
    it. And I being the youngest Apprentice was to be commanded by every
    one; the two eldest would appoint what I was to do in the Shop, and the
    Kitchin-wench would, when she pleased, command me into the Kitchin, so
    that I must be here and there and everywhere; and above all things,
    I must humor and please the Maid, or else she would pick Holes in my
    Coat, and tell Tales of me to my Mistress, who would not let me live a
    quiet hour” (<cite>The Unlucky Citizen</cite>, pp. 35–37).
  </p>

  <p>
    Presently, having served for three years, and being now nineteen years
    of age, he complained to his father:—
  </p>

  <p>
    “But I was little the better for it; for no sooner was I come into
    my Master’s House, but he seeing me, enters his Closet, from whence
    fetches a lusty Battoon Cane (the ordinary Weapon with which I was used
    to be disciplined), and without by your leave, or with your Leave, he
    takes me by the hand, and lifting up his Sword Arm like a Fencer, he
    gives me a lusty Thwack over the Shoulders, and without any warning
    given, not so much as the least word of Defyance, that I might know
    his anger, or the cause of it, he follows that blow by a second and a
    third, and many more, so fast and so long as he could lay on, till he,
    being out of breath, was forced to give over, and then so soon as he
    had recovered the use of his Tongue, he thus breaks silence, ‘Sirrah,
    I’le teach you to run and make complaints to your Father.’ I now having
    heard him speak, knew whereabouts he was, but methought the News was
    strange and sudden, and somewhat I began to mutter,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span> but my Tale would
    not be heard; he prosecuted his business with the Second Part to the
    same Tune, both upon my Sides and Shoulders till he was again weary,
    and then there being a cessation of Arms, down I sate me, not daring to
    speak a word; but though I said nothing, yet I paid it with thinking,
    but all to little purpose; he was Master, and I found so he would
    continue” (<cite>The Unlucky Citizen</cite>, pp. 43, 44).
  </p>

  <p>
    A master at that time had a perfect right to beat his servants; nor
    does the writer complain, except that there was, perhaps, too much laid
    on. It will be remembered that the wife of Pepys caned her maids. F.
    K., however, does point out the vile treatment of apprentices by some
    of their masters, and their advantage in it:—
  </p>

  <p>
    “And let me tell you that I have observed and known that some Citizens
    have much encreased their Estates by taking many Apprentices, for
    perhaps having fifty pounds or more with an Apprentice, and being very
    severe and rigid, the boy hath been so hardly used, that he hath run
    away within a year, and rather than return again, lose all his Money.
    I knew one that served eight so, one after another, and in three or
    four years, by this means, gained four hundred pounds for their diet,
    which they likewise earned, causing them to work like Porters, so that
    I think they paid dear enough for it; they had been better to have been
    boarded at the costliest Boarding-school in England; and besides the
    loss of the Money, there was a worse inconvenience, for the Apprentice
    hath been quite spoiled, so harassed and frighted, that he hath not
    been fit for any other service, and for the sake of his first Master,
    would not be perswaded to go to any other” (<cite>The Unlucky Citizen</cite>, pp.
    144, 145).
  </p>

  <p>
    After being taken from this master and transferred to another, who
    turned him out of the house for betraying confidence, F. K. was set
    up in business by his father, opening a small scrivener’s shop on
    Tower Hill. If his bad luck through life was like his bad luck as an
    apprentice, it was due to his own folly and stupidity. For instance,
    he says that he was arrested a few days after he was married, for his
    wedding clothes. Why, then, did he not pay for them? And so on. But we
    need not follow the <cite>Unlucky Citizen</cite> any farther.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Sumptuary Laws against Apprentices so stringently enacted in the
    preceding century were still in force, and a youth who dared to array
    himself in finery other than befitted his craft, ran the risk of being
    forcibly despoiled of his ribbons and adornments and being reduced to a
    severe simplicity of apparel.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here is a glimpse of life furnished by Howell when he placed his two
    younger brothers apprentices in the City:—
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “Our two younger Brothers, which you sent hither, are disposed of;
      my Brother Doctor hath placed the elder of the two with Mr. Hawes,
      a Mercer in Cheapside, and he took much Pains in it; and I had
      placed my Brother Ned with Mr. Barrington, a Silk-man in the same
      Street; but afterwards, for some inconveniences, I removed him to
      one Mr. Smith, at the Flower de luce in Lombard Street, a Mercer
      also. Their Masters both of them are very well to pass, and of good
      repute; I think it will prove some
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>advantage to them hereafter
      to be both of one Trade; because, when they are out of their time,
      they may join Stocks together; so that I hope they are as well
      placed as any two Youths in London; but you must not use to send
      them such large Tokens in Money, for that may corrupt them. When I
      went to bind my brother Ned Apprentice in Drapers-Hall, casting my
      eyes upon the Chimney-piece of the great Room, I spied a Picture
      of an ancient Gentlemen, and underneath <i>Thomas</i> Howell; I asked
      the Clerk about him, and he told me that he was a Spanish Merchant
      in Henry VIII.’s time, and coming home rich, and dying a Batchelor,
      he gave that Hall to the Company of Drapers, with other things, so
      that he is accounted one of the chiefest Benefactors. I told the
      Clerk, that one of the Sons of Thomas Howell came now thither to
      be bound; he answered, that if he be a right Howell, he may have,
      when he is free, three hundred Pounds to help set up, and pay no
      interest for five years. It may be hereafter we will make use of
      this. He told me also, that any Maid that can prove her Father
      to be a true Howell may come and demand Fifty pounds towards her
      portion, of the said Hall.”

  </div>

  <p class="noindent">
    <span class="smcap">The</span> chapter on trade under the Stuarts may be introduced by certain
    extracts from a paper written by Sir Walter Raleigh early in the
    seventeenth century. It was called “Observations on Trade and
    Commerce,” in which he compares the Dutch trade and Dutch merchants
    with our own, very much to our disadvantage. The following, he says,
    are the seven points in which the Dutch surpass us:—
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “1. The Merchant Staplers which maketh all Things in abundance, by
      reason of their Store-houses continually replenished with all kinds
      of Commodities.
    </p>

    <p>
      2. The Liberty of free Traffick for Strangers to buy and sell in
      Holland, and other Countries and States, as if they were free-born,
      maketh great intercourse.
    </p>

    <p>
      3. The small Duties levied upon Merchants, draws all Nations to
      trade with them.
    </p>

    <p>
      4. Their fashioned ships continually freighted before ours, by
      reason of their few Mariners and great Bulk, serving the Merchant
      cheap.
    </p>

    <p>5. Their forwardness to further all manner of Trading.</p>

    <p>
      6. Their wonderful employment of their Busses for Fishing, and the
      great Returns they make.
    </p>

    <p>
      7. Their giving free Custom inwards and outwards, for any
      new-erected Trade, by Means whereof they have gotten already almost
      the sole Trade into their hands.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “Thus,” he goes on, “as regards the storing of merchandize,
      Amsterdam is never without a supply of 700,000 quarters of corn,
      which they keep always ready besides what they sell; and the like
      with other commodities, so that if a Dearth of Fish, wine, grain,
      or anything else begins in the country, forthwith the Dutch are
      ready with fifty or a hundred ships dispersing themselves at every
      ‘Port-Town’ in England, trading away their cargoes and carrying off
      English gold. Moreover, the Dutch have in their hands the greater
      part of the carrying trade of France, Portugal, Spain, Italy,
      Turkey, the East Indies, and the West Indies. Yet London is a much
      more convenient port for a store-house and for the carrying trade
      if our merchants would but bend their course for it.”
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    As for small duties in foreign countries compared with the excessive
    customs in ours. James, it will be remembered, relied on his Customs
    duties, which were heavy, thereby keeping off foreign trade. In Holland
    the Customs duties were so much lighter that a ship which would pay
    £900 in the port of London could be cleared at Amsterdam for £50.
    Raleigh points out that what is lost by lowering the duties is more
    than made up by the increase of trade when the duties are low. He
    advocates Free Trade, observe, long before that innovation was thought
    of.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span></p>

  <p>
    By the “fashion” of the ships he means the Dutch merchant vessels
    called “Boyers, Hoy-barks, and Hoys,” constructed to contain a great
    bulk of merchandise and to sail with a small crew. Thus an English ship
    of 200 tons required a crew of thirty hands, while a ship of the same
    tonnage built in Holland wanted no more than nine or ten mariners.
  </p>

    </div>
    <div class="link"><a href="#trans_191">Go to transcription of text</a></div>
  </div>

  <p>
    Then, again, as to their “forwardness” in trading. In one year and a
    half the merchants of Holland, Hamburg, and Emden carried off from
    Southampton, Exeter, and Bristol alone near £200,000 in gold. And
    perhaps £2,000,000, taking the whole of the kingdom into account. The
    Dutch alone sent 500 or 600 ships every year to England, while we sent
    but thirty to Holland.
  </p>

  <p>
    A warning and an example is presented by the fallen and decayed
    condition of Genoa. Formerly this city was the most prosperous of all
    trading cities. All nations traded there; but in an evil moment Genoa
    declared a Customs duty of 10 per cent, which caused the whole of
    her trade to vanish. Why, again, Raleigh asks, do we not secure for
    ourselves the magnificent fisheries which lie off our shores? In
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span> four
    towns within the Sound are sold every year between 30,000 and 40,000
    casts of herrings, representing £620,000. In Denmark, Norway, Sweden,
    etc., are sold our herrings, caught on our shores, to the amount of
    £170,000. This fishery represents over a million sterling in addition
    to all this. They are herrings caught off our shores, and yet we have
    no share in this great trade.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Dutch employ a thousand ships in carrying salt to the East
    Kingdoms; we none. They have 600 ships in the timber trade; we none;
    they send into the East Kingdoms 3000 ships every year; we 100 only.
    They carry goods from the East Kingdoms to France, Spain, Portugal, and
    Italy in 2000 ships; we have none in that trade. They trade to all the
    ports of France; we to five or six only. They trade with every one of
    our ports—with 600 ships; we with three only of these ports, and but
    forty ships.
  </p>

  </div>

  <p>
    We neglect to take advantage of what we have. For instance, we send to
    Holland our cloth undressed; we let them take, for purposes of trade,
    our iron, our coal, our copper, lead, tin, alum, copperas, and other
    things on which we might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
    employ thousands of people, and this country,
    which produces nothing, is enriched by carrying commodities about the
    world.
  </p>

  <p>
    The arguments of Raleigh in favour of taking up the fisheries appear
    elementary. He thus sums up the advantages:—
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="less">
      “1. For taking God’s blessing out of the Sea to enrich the Realm,
      which otherwise we lose.
    </p>

    <p>2. For setting the People on work.</p>

    <p>3. For making Plenty of Cheapness in the Realm.</p>

    <p>4. For increasing of Shipping, to make the Land powerful.</p>

    <p>5. For a continual Nursery for breeding and increasing our Mariners.</p>

    <p>
      6. For making employment of all Sorts of People, as blind, lame,
      and others, by Sea and Land, from ten or twelve years and upwards.
    </p>

    <p>
      7. For inriching your Majesty’s Coffers, by Merchandises returned
      from other Countries for Fish and Herrings.
    </p>

    <p>
      8. For the increase and enabling of Merchants, which now droop and
      daily decay.”
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    The trade of London during the first half of the seventeenth century
    decayed. The decay was due partly to the monopoly of the privileged
    companies, which stifled or discouraged enterprise; partly to the
    civil wars; partly to the Customs duties; and partly, it would seem,
    to a falling off in the vigour and enterprise which had marked the
    Elizabethan period. In trade, as in everything, there are times of
    reaction and of torpor. Meantime, in spite of everything, foreign trade
    increased. But Raleigh’s comparison between the trade of Holland and
    that of London shows how small our foreign trade was, in comparison
    with the vast bulk carried on by the Dutch.
  </p>

  <p>
    After Sir Walter Raleigh’s “observations” let me quote Howell on the
    profession or calling of the merchant:—
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “For my part I do not know any profession of Life (especially in
      an Island) more to be cherished and countenanced with honourable
      employments than the Merchant-Adventurer (I do not mean only
      the staplers of Hamburgh and Rotterdam); for if valiant and
      dangerous actions do enoble a Man, and make him merit, surely the
      Merchant-Adventurer deserves more Honour than any; for he is to
      encounter not only with Men of all Tempers and Humours (as a French
      Counsellor hath it), but he contests and tugs oft-time with all the
      Elements; nor do I see how some of our Country Squires, who sell
      Calves and Runts, and their Wives perhaps Cheese and Apples, should
      be held more genteel than the noble Merchant-Adventurer who sells
      Silks and Satins, Tissues and Cloths of Gold, Diamonds and Pearl,
      with Silver and Gold.”
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    In the year 1606 James made an attempt to introduce the breeding of
    silkworms. He sent mulberry-trees into the country with instructions
    for the feeding of the worms. There was a certain amount of
    English-grown silk manufactured, as is shown by an entry in Thoresby’s
    <cite>Diary</cite>. “Saw at Mr. Gale’s a sample of the satin lately made at
    Chelsea of English silkworms, for the Princess of Wales, which was very
    rich and beautiful.” The experiment proved unsuccessful, yet it caused
    the immigration of a great number of silk throwsters, weavers, and
    dyers, who settled here and entered upon the silk trade in London. The
    raw silk was brought from India and China by the East India Company.

    A table of imports from India in 1620 gives the most astonishing
    difference<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
    between the cost in India and the selling price in London

    In 1620 the East India Company established themselves at Madras, where
    they had a trade in diamonds, muslin, and chintzes in return for
    English or European goods. They had in their service 2500 mariners, 500
    ship carpenters, and 120 factors.
  </p>

  <p>
    The story of Cockaine’s patent should be (but it was not) a lesson in
    Free Trade. It was this man’s custom to send white cloth from England
    to Holland to be dyed and dressed, and then sent back for sale.
    Alderman Cockaine proposed to the King to do the dyeing and dressing
    himself if he had a patent. He represented that the whole profit made
    by the Dutch would be saved by this arrangement. The King consented;
    he prohibited the exportation of white cloth to Holland, and seized
    the charter of the Merchant Adventurers which allowed them to export
    it. The Dutch naturally retaliated by prohibiting the importation of
    English dye cloths. It was then discovered that Cockaine could not do
    what he proposed to do; his cloths were worse dyed and were dearer than
    those dyed by the Dutch. After seven years of complaints over this
    business, the patent was removed and the charter restored.
  </p>

  <p>The following is a statement of the trade of England at this time:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “We trade to Naples, Genoa, Leghorn, Marseilles, Malaga, etc., with
      only twenty ships, chiefly herrings, and thirty sail more laden
      with pipes-staves from Ireland.
    </p>

    <p>
      To Portugal and Andalusia we sent twenty ships for wines, sugar,
      fruit, and West Indian drugs.
    </p>

    <p>To Bordeaux we send sixty ships and barks for wines.</p>

    <p>
      To Hamburgh and Middleburgh, thirty-five ships are sent by our
      Merchant Adventurers’ Company.
    </p>

    <p>
      To Dantzic, Koningsburg, etc., we send yearly about thirty ships,
      viz. six from London, six from Ipswich, and the rest from Hull,
      Lynn, and Newcastle, but the Dutch many more.
    </p>

    <p>
      To Norway we send not above five ships, and the Dutch above forty,
      and great ships too.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our Newcastle coal trade employs 400 sail of ships; viz. 200 for
      supplying of London, and 200 for the rest of England.
    </p>

    <p>
      And besides our own ships, hither, even to the mine’s mouth,
      come all our neighbouring nations with
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>their ships continually,
      employing their own shipping and mariners. I doubt not whether, if
      they had such a treasure, they would employ not their own shipping
      solely therein. The French sail thither in whole fleets of fifty
      sail together, serving all their ports of Picardie, Normandie,
      Bretagne, etc., even as far as Rochel and Bordeaux. And the ships
      of Bremen, Emden, Holland, and Zealand supply those of Flanders,
      etc., whose shipping is not great, with our coals.
    </p>

    <p>Our Iceland fishery employs 120 ships and barks of our own.</p>

    <p>And the Newfoundland fishery 150 small ships.</p>

    <p>And our Greenland whale fishery fourteen ships.</p>

    <p>
      As for the Bermudas, we know not yet what they will do; and for
      Virginia, we know not what to do with it; the present profit of
      these two colonies not employing any store of shipping” (Capper, p.
      84).
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    The completion of the New River in 1620 was a great boon and blessing
    to the people, but the greatest benefit to trade in the reign of James
    I. was the improvement of the navigation of the upper part of the
    Thames by deepening the channel, so that not only was Oxford placed in
    communication with London, but the country all round Oxford.
  </p>

  <p>
    The granting of monopolies was an interference with trade which
    would now cause a revolution. There were many complaints. Parliament
    declared that all monopolies were void. That was under James. Charles
    began, notwithstanding, to sell monopolies to whomsoever would pay
    him most for them. Thus the importation of alum was prohibited, for
    the protection of the alum works of Whitby; also brick-making, the
    manufacture of saltpetre, of tapestry, the coining of farthings, the
    making of steel, the making of stone pots and jugs, making guns,
    melting iron ore, and many other things. More than this, Charles made
    the sale of tobacco a royal monopoly; he forbade the infant colony of
    Virginia to sell tobacco to any foreign state; he levied a duty of
    four shillings a chaldron on all coal exported to foreign parts; and
    he actually endeavoured to establish a malting and a brewing monopoly.
    When we read the historian on the despotic acts of Charles and his
    attempts on the liberties of his people, let us bear in mind the
    constant exasperations of these interferences with trade—that is, with
    the livelihood of the people. When at last he became awakened to the
    danger of the position, he revoked all their “grants, licences, and
    privileges”; but it was then too late—revolution had already arisen.
  </p>

  <p>
    Shops which had been open stalls confined to one or two markets in
    London, such as East and West Chepe, began, towards the end of the
    sixteenth century and early in the seventeenth, to appear along Fleet
    Street, the Strand, and in King Street, Westminster. Haberdashers,
    milliners, woollen drapers, cutlers, upholsterers, glassmen, perfumers,
    and others established themselves everywhere, making so brave a show
    every day, that, as Stow complains, “the people of London began
    to expend extravagantly.” There were offered, among other wares,
    “French and Spanish gloves, and French cloth or frigarde (frieze),
    Flanders-dyed kersies, daggers, swords, knives, Spanish girdles,
    painted cruses, dials, tables, cards, balls, glasses, fine earthen
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
    pots, salt-cellars, spoons, tin dishes, puppets, pennons, ink-horns,
    toothpicks, silk, and silver buttons. All which ‘made such a show in
    passengers’ eyes, that they could not help gazing on and buying these
    knicknacks.’ This great offence a contemporary writer, quoted by Stow,
    bitterly apostrophises. He ‘marvels’ that ‘no man taketh heed to it
    what number of trifles cometh hither from beyond the seas, that we
    might either clean spare, or else make them within our own realm;
    for the which we either pay inestimable treasure every year, or else
    exchange substantial wares and necessaries for them, for the which we
    might receive great treasure.”
  </p>

  <p>
    There had then arisen outside the City a new class, and one which was
    becoming wealthy and important, namely, the suburban shopkeepers. They
    were certainly not a class that Charles could afford to exasperate. But
    apparently he never asked himself how far it was prudent to exasperate
    any class. Thus, in the blindness of his wrath against the Puritans,
    whose emigration was the best thing that could happen to him, he
    forbade them to emigrate without a certificate of having taken the
    oath of allegiance and supremacy, and likewise from the minister of
    their parish a certificate of their conversation and conformity to the
    orders and discipline of the Church of England. He therefore did what
    he could to preserve his own enemies in his kingdom, and to increase
    their hostility. Again, he ordered that the Weavers’ Company should
    admit to its freedom none but members of the Church of England. He even
    interfered with trade to the extent of trading on his own account,
    on one occasion buying up all the pepper imported by the East India
    Company and selling it again at a profit.
  </p>

  <p>
    The foundation of the banking business is said to date from the
    outbreak of the Civil War; perhaps it was partly due to that event.
    Banking was impossible in earlier times for several reasons: there was
    no system of commercial credit; there were no bank-notes; goods were
    bought or sold for actual coin; there was no Exchange; when men went
    abroad or came home, they had to take their foreign money to the Mint
    for re-coinage, or they had to get foreign money at the Mint; there was
    no recognised system of lending or borrowing; if a man borrowed money
    he did so as a special occasion and for a special purpose, and paid a
    large interest for the accommodation. The money-lenders were the Jews
    first, who carried on the trade as a Royal monopoly, followed by the
    Lombards, who came as the agents of Papal taxation; and afterwards the
    London merchants and goldsmiths.
  </p>

  <p>
    When the Civil War broke out it became a serious consideration with the
    merchants to place their money in some place of security. The Mint,
    their former place of deposit, could not be trusted because Charles
    had already seized upon £200,000 belonging to merchants, and placed
    there for safety; their own strong rooms would not do, because if the
    City fell into the hands of the Royalists, the strong room would most
    certainly be plundered first.<a id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
    They therefore began to
    lodge their cash in the hands of goldsmiths, keeping what was called a
    “running cash” account. They probably thought that in case of need the
    goldsmiths could take their money and plate abroad. Country gentlemen
    also began to send their money up to London for greater security. This
    method was found so convenient that banking quickly spread and the
    bankers began to flourish. During the Commonwealth one Henry Robinson
    proposed the establishment of a “Land Bank,” with branches in the
    country to lend money upon mortgage, the payments to be by paper.

      THE FIRST ROYAL EXCHANGE—EXTERIOR AND INTERIOR
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
    The wars with the Dutch and the extraordinary developments of French
    industries caused our imports to vastly exceed our exports; every
    maid-servant, it was said, paid the French King half her wages; when
    peace came and trade was recovering, the madness of Charles II. in
    closing the Exchequer paralysed and ruined the City for a while. Never
    did monarch inflict a blow so cruel upon his people. And never did the
    Stuarts recover the confidence which this measure lost them.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Plague of 1665, followed by the Fire, proved, as might be expected,
    a temporary check to the prosperity of the City. But the people kept up
    their courage.
  </p>

  <p>
    After the Fire there was built, in place of Gresham’s Exchange, which
    had been burned, a new Royal Exchange of which the first stone was laid
    by King Charles II.
  </p>

  <p>
    The increase of trade, although petty trade, in the West was recognised
    in the foundation of the New Exchange, an institution which has been
    mostly overlooked by historians.
  </p>

  <p>
    “This building was erected by Robert, Earl of Salisbury, somewhat after
    the shape of the Royal Exchange, having cellars underneath and paved
    walks above with rows of shops. The first stone was laid on the 10th of
    June 1608. It was opened by King James I., April 10th, 1609, who came
    attended by the Queen, the Duke of York, the Lady Elizabeth, and many
    great lords and ladies, but it was not successful” (<cite>Stow</cite>).
  </p>

  <p>
    “In the Strand on the N. side of Durham House stood an olde long
    stable, the outer wall whereof on the street side was very olde and
    ruinate, all which was taken down and a stately building sodainely
    erected in the place by Robert, E. of Salisbury, Lord High Treasurer
    of England. The first stone of this beautiful building was laid the
    10th of June last past, and was fully finished in November following.
    And on Tuesday, the 10th April, the year (1609), many of the upper
    shoppes were richly furnished with wares, and the next day after that,
    the King, Queen and Prince, the Lady Elizabeth and the D. of York,
    with many great Lordes and chief ladies, came thither, and were there
    entertained with pleasant speeches, gifts, and ingenious devices:
    there the King gave it a name and called it Britain’s Burse” (Nich.,
    <cite>Progresses</cite>, vol. ii. p. 248).

  <p>
    The exports and the imports of London during fifty years of this
    century are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>

    The prosperity of the country was shown by the contemporary writers
    to have been advancing steadily and rapidly, in spite of the civil
    wars, the Dutch wars, the pestilence which on five separate occasions
    devastated the country and the City, and the Great Fire which destroyed
    all the “Stock” of the merchants. Sir William Petty (1676) observes
    that the number of houses in London was double that of 1636, and that
    there had been a great increase of houses in many towns of the United
    Kingdom, that the Royal Navy was four times as powerful as in later
    years, that the coal trade of Newcastle had quadrupled, the Customs
    yielded three times their former value, that more than 40,000 tons
    of shipping were employed in the Guinea and American trade, that
    the King’s revenue was trebled, and that the postage of letters had
    increased from one to twenty.
  </p>

  <p>
    Davenant also (1698) speaks twenty years later to the same effect. He
    shows that the value of land had risen from twelve years’ purchase in
    former times to fourteen, sixteen, and twenty years’ purchase in 1666;
    and by the end of the century to twenty-six or even more; that great
    quantities of waste land had been enclosed and cultivated; that the
    merchant marine had doubled between 1666 and 1688; that many noble
    buildings had been erected; that the Customs duties had increased
    in twenty years by a third; that the standard of comfort among the
    working-classes was greatly improved; and that property in cattle,
    stock-in-trade, and personal effects had risen from £17,000,000 in 1600
    to £88,000,000 in 1688.
  </p>

  <p>
    As already mentioned, the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes brought
    to this country some 70,000 of the most highly skilled artificers.
    Many thousands settled in the suburbs of London, especially in Bethnal
    Green, Spitalfields, and St. Giles. Among the things they made or
    prepared were “light woollens, silk, linen, writing-paper, glass,
    hats, lute-string, silks, brocades, satins, velvets, watches, cutlery,
    clocks, jacks, locks, surgeons’ instruments, hardware, and toys”
    (<cite>Capper</cite>, p. 103).
  </p>

  <p>
    These refugees gave the country a large and valuable industry in
    silk-weaving; it is also supposed that the manufacture of fine paper
    was due to the French immigrants. In 1670 the Duke of Buckingham
    brought Venetians over here who introduced the manufacture of fine
    glass.
  </p>

  <p>
    The making of linen cloth and tapestry was encouraged by an Act of
    1666, which offered special advantages to those who set up the trade of
    hemp dressing. In 1669 certain French Protestants settled at Ipswich
    and engaged in this trade.
  </p>

  <p>
    The old industry of woollen cloth was protected by the prohibition to
    export<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
    wool. In 1666 a law was passed directing that every one should
    be buried in wool, and the clergy were required to take an affidavit to
    that effect at every interment.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 1676 the printing of calicoes was commenced in London. A writer of
    the day says that “instead of green say, that was wont to be used for
    children’s frocks, is now used painted and Indian and striped calico,
    and instead of perpetuam or shalloon to line men’s coats with is used
    sometimes glazed calico, which in the whole is not a shilling cheaper,
    and abundantly worse.”
  </p>

  <p>
    An Act passed in 1662 forbade the importation of foreign bone lace, cut
    work, embroidery, fringe, band-strings, buttons, and needlework on the
    ground that many persons in this country made their living by this work.
  </p>

  <p>
    The art of tinning plate-iron was brought over from Germany. The first
    wire-mill was also put up at this period by a Dutchman.
  </p>

  <p>
    In short, the development of the arts was largely advanced during the
    century, and almost entirely by foreigners—French, German, Venetian,
    and Dutch.
  </p>

  <p>
    The income of the Crown does not belong to the history of London,
    except that the City furnished a large part of it. That of Charles
    II. was ordered by the Parliament, August 31, 1660, to be made up to
    £1,200,000 a year. To raise this sum various Acts were passed. Thus
    there was the subsidy called “tonnage” levied upon foreign wine, and
    that called “pundage” levied upon the export and import of certain
    commodities. These taxes were collected at the Custom House. There
    was also the excise upon beer, ale, and other liquors sold within the
    kingdom. There was the tax of hearth money, which was two shillings
    upon any fire, hearth, or stove in every house worth more than twenty
    shillings a year. There were also the Royal lands, such as the Forest
    of Dean, the duties on the mines in the Duchy of Cornwall, the
    first-fruits and tenths of church benefices, the Post Office, etc.
    Other duties were laid occasionally on land, on personal property, on
    the sale of wine, etc. It must be remembered, however, that the King
    maintained out of this income the Fleet and the Army.
  </p>

  <p>
    The coinage current in London consisted of more kinds than the present
    simpler system. In gold there were sovereigns, half-sovereigns, crowns,
    and half-crowns; in silver, crowns, half-crowns, shillings, sixpences,
    half-groats, pennies, and halfpennies. To this there were added from
    time to time the Thistle crown of four shillings, the Scottish six
    pound gold coin valued at ten shillings, the French crown called “The
    Sun,” valued at seven shillings. There were also farthing tokens in
    lead, tin, copper, and leather.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ben Jonson shows us what kind of money was carried about. “The man had
    120 Edward’s shillings, one old Harry sovereign, three James shillings,
    an Elizabeth groat: in all twenty nobles”—a noble was worth 7s. 2d.;
    “also he had some Philip and Marias, a half-crown of gold about his
    wrist that his love gave him, and a leaden heart when she forsook him.”
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span></p>

  <p>
    “Before the reign of James I. nothing beyond pennies and halfpennies
    in silver appear to have been attempted to supply the poor with a
    currency. In 1611 Sir Robert Cotton propounded a scheme for a copper
    coinage; this was not, however, carried out. A scheme to enrich the
    king produced the farthing token, weighing six grains, and producing
    24s. 3d. for the pound weight of copper; half the profit was to be
    the king’s and the other half the patentee’s. The first patent was
    granted to Baron Harrington of Exton, Rutlandshire, April 10, 1613,
    and a Proclamation was issued May 19, 1613, forbidding the use of
    traders’ tokens in lead, copper, or brass. The new coin was to bear, on
    the one side, the King’s title, ‘Jaco. D. G. Mag. Bri., two sceptres
    through a crown;’ on the reverse, ‘Fra. et. Hib. Rex., a harp crowned.’
    The mint mark, a rose. A Proclamation was published June 4, 1625,
    prohibiting any one from counterfeiting this coin. Upon the death of
    Lord Harrington, in 1614, the Patent was confirmed to Lady Harrington
    and her assigns; subsequently it was granted to the Duke of Lennox and
    James, Marquis of Hamilton, and on the 11th of July 1625 to Frances,
    Duchess Dowager of Richmond and Lennox, and Sir Francis Crane, Knight,
    for seventeen years, the patentees paying to the King one hundred
    marks yearly. By a Proclamation issued in 1633, the counterfeiters of
    these tokens were, upon conviction, to be fined £100 apiece, to be
    set on the pillory in Cheapside, and from thence whipped through the
    streets to Old Bridewell, and there kept to work; and when enlarged,
    to find sureties for their good behaviour. On the 3rd of August 1644
    the Mayor, Aldermen, and Commons of the City of London petitioned
    the House of Commons against the inconvenience of this coin, and the
    hardship suffered by the poor in consequence. No farthing tokens
    being issued during the Commonwealth, private persons were under the
    necessity of striking their own tokens. The practice being, however,
    contrary to law, was subsequently prohibited by a Proclamation issued
    August 16, 1672. It further appears, by an advertisement in the
    <cite>London Gazette</cite>, No. 714, September 23, 1672, that an office called the
    ‘Farthing Office’ was opened in Fenchurch Street, near Mincing Lane,
    for the issue of these coins on Tuesday in each week, and in 1673–4 an
    order was passed to open the office daily. These measures not proving
    effectual to prevent private coinage of tokens, another Proclamation
    was issued on October 17, 1673, and another on December 12, 1674. These
    farthing tokens encountered the contempt and scorn of all persons to
    whom they were tendered, as being of the smallest possible value.
    Sarcastic allusions were made to them by dramatists, poets, and wits.
    ‘Meercroft,’ in Ben Jonson’s <cite>Devill is an Asse</cite>, Act ii. sc. 1, played
    in 1616, alludes to this coin and its patentee” (<cite>Index to Remem.</cite> pp.
    89, 90, <i>note</i>).
  </p>

  <p>
    In 1694 the London tradesmen began to cry out about the badness of the
    coinage; vast numbers of halfpence and farthings were forged, and the
    chipping of the silver went on almost openly. The Government resolved
    on an entirely new issue, which was complete in 1699.

    It was not a time of universal prosperity; witness the following
    account of the Grocers’ Company (Ninth Report, Historical MSS.):—
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “27th March 1673. The Grocers’ proposal for payment of their debts.
      The Company’s year rents and revenues amount to only £722:5:4,
      and are charged with a yearly payment of £7571:19:8 in charity.
      Their debts are £24,000. In 1640 they lent the king £4500, for
      repayment whereof some of the Peers became bound. In 1642 they
      advanced £9000 for suppressing the Irish Rebellion. In 1643 they
      lent the City of London £4500. The principal and interest of these
      several debts, still owing to the Company as aforesaid, amount to
      above £40,000. The greater part of their estate was in houses burnt
      down in the late Fire, and since leased out for 60, 70, and 80
      years, by decrees made in the late Court of Judicature established
      by Act of Parliament. The several sums they owe were voluntarily
      lent them. They propose that £12,000 be raised by voluntary
      subscriptions and equally distributed among all their creditors
      within six months; that, to discharge the rest of their debt, the
      debts owing to the Company be assigned to trustees; that a special
      memorandum be entered in the Company’s books, that, in case the
      creditors be not satisfied by the means proposed, the Company
      shall, if ever in a capacity hereafter, pay the whole remainder to
      every creditor; and that, on performance of these proposals, the
      Company be absolutely discharged from all their debts. Meanwhile
      all prosecutions against the Company to be stayed, that the Company
      may be animated cheerfully to raise the money. The Company submit,
      in conclusion, that a Hall encumbered and not half finished is
      all the Company of Grocers have to encourage their members to a
      voluntary contribution to satisfy debts contracted before most of
      them were born, and before all the residue, save some few only,
      were free of the Company. (Offered this day, having been called for
      by the Committee on the 24th. Rejected as ‘not satisfactory’ on the
      28th. Com. Book of date.)

      28th March. Answer of the Appellants. The Company, besides their
      £722:15:4 for rents in England, have an estate of nearly £400
      rental in Ireland, and their Hall, with appurtenances worth £200 a

      more. The lands charged with charitable uses are expressly
      excepted by the decree. The estate is let at quit-rents, and, if
      rack-rented, would yield another £12,000. The yearly contributions
      of members amount to another £1000.

      Besides this they can at pleasure raise in a month’s time, by fines
      for offices and calling to livery, £4000. Most of their debts are
      recent. Their loans to the City should be sued for by themselves.
      The loan of 1643 was to defend the City against the King. The
      Company did not suffer much by the Fire, as most of their estate
      was let on long leases. All the creditors have received one-sixth
      of their claims, except the Cholmleys, who have been promised
      payment since the decree, but have received nothing. The Company
      itself is willing to pay its debts, but is prevented by a small
      minority, who are the authors of the proposal, and dishonestly deny
      liability. Appellants cannot agree to stand equally with the rest
      of the creditors, who refused to join them at first before the suit
      commenced, and only sued the Company at its own litigation, with
      a view to forestall Appellants. They cannot accept the Grocers’
      proposals in lieu of the decree they hold. The Company have already
      offered more favourable terms, which have been refused. The Hall
      is actually sequestered, and was so before its conveyance to the
      Lord Mayor, etc. of London, as Governors of Christ’s Hospital.
      The Company’s estate is sufficient to cover their claim, in which
      Appellants are supported by several members of the Company itself.
      If the Company will give good personal security to discharge their
      debts in seven years, and to pay at once the sixth part of the
      principal to the Cholmleys, with interest from the time others had
      it, with costs, Appellants will accept these terms, assign over
      their sequestration, and help them to pay their other creditors;
      otherwise they pray the sale may be enforced. (Put in this day, but
      rejected by the Grocers’ Counsel. Com. Book of date.”)

    Another company was also struggling with difficulties, as the following
    extract from the same Report shows:—
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “10th March, 1675. The petition of the Master, Warden, Assistants
      and Commonaltie of the Corporation of Pin-makers, London, to the
      King; with paper of proposals attached thereto Reminding his
      Majesty of a contract made between Him and their Company, for
      the benefit alike of His Majesty and the London Pin-makers, that
      came to nought in consequence of the Great Plague and the Dutch,
      the Pin-makers beg for an aid of £20,000—£10,000 thereof to be
      laid out in wire, to be bought of His Majesty at 30d. per hundred
      weight about the current rate of such wire; and the other £10,000
      thereof to be used as a fund by Commissioners, and the pins being
      distributed to buyers at a cost sufficient only to cover the charge
      of production. By operation of the scheme, embodied in these
      proposals, it is urged the trade of the pin-making will revive, the
      pin-makers will have full and lucrative employment, and his Majesty
      will by his profit on the wire receive a revenue of at least £4000
      per annum.”
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    The most important civic event in the reign of William was the
    foundation of the Bank of England. The bankers of the City had been,
    as we have seen, the goldsmiths, who not only received and kept money
    for their customers, but lent it out, for them and for themselves, on
    interest. Thus, when Charles the Second, on January 2, 1672, closed the
    Exchequer, his creditors could obtain neither principal nor interest.
    He then owed the goldsmiths of London the sum of £1,328,526.
    Some of the older banks of London trace a descent to the goldsmiths of the
    seventeenth century—Child’s, for instance, Hoare’s, and others.

    The idea of a National Bank seems to have been considered and discussed
    for some years before it was carried into effect. The principal
    advocate of the scheme was a Scotchman named William Anderson. The
    advantages which he put forward in defence of the Bank were the support
    of public credit and the relief of the Government from the ruinous
    terms upon which supplies were then raised. There was great difficulty
    in getting the scheme considered, but it was at last passed by an Act
    of Parliament in 1693. By the terms of this Act it was provided that
    the Government should take a loan of £1,200,000 from the Bank, this
    amount to be subscribed; additional taxes were imposed which would
    produce about £140,000 a year, out of which the Bank was to receive
    £100,000 a year, including interest at 8 per cent, and £4000 a year for
    management. The Company was empowered to purchase lands, and to deal in
    bills of exchange and gold and silver bullion, but not to buy or sell
    merchandise, though they might sell unredeemed goods on which they had
    made advances.
  </p>

  <p>
    The subscription for the £1,200,000 was completed in ten days. The Bank
    began its business on July 27, 1694.
  </p>

  <p>
    Its offices were at first the Grocers’ Hall, where they continued until
    the year 1743. In this year the new building, part of the present
    edifice, was completed.
  </p>

  <p>Maitland describes it as</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “A most magnificent structure; the front next the street is about
      80 feet in length, adorned with columns, entablature, etc., of the
      Ionick order. There is a handsome courtyard between this and the
      main building, which, like the other, is of stone, and adorned with
      pillars, pilasters, entablature, and triangular pediment of the
      Corinthian Order. The hall is 79 feet in length, and 40 in breadth,
      is wainscotted about 8 feet high, has a fine fretwork ceiling,
      and a large Venetian window at the west end of it. Beyond this
      is another quadrangle, with an arcade on the east and west sides
      of it: and on the north is the Accomptant’s Office, which is 60
      feet long, and 28 feet broad. There are handsome apartments over
      this and the other sides of the quadrangle, with a fine staircase
      adorned with fretwork; and under it are large vaults, that have
      very strong walls and iron gates for the p reservation of the cash.”
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    By the charter they constituted a Governor, who must have £4000 in
    Bank stock; a Deputy Governor, who must have £3000; and twenty-four
    Directors, who must have £2000 each.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Bank, although a year or two after its foundation its utility was
    fully recognised by merchants, did not command complete confidence
    for many years. Pamphlets were written against it. They were answered
    in 1707 by Nathaniel Tench, a merchant. The defence is instructive.
    Maitland sums it up:—
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “The chief purpose of this defence was to vindicate a corporation,
      and the management thereof; not so much from crimes they had
      already been guilty of in the experiment of eleven or twelve years,
      as the fear of what they might do hereafter.”
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    The charter of the Bank was renewed in 1697 to 1711; in 1708 to 1733;
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
    in 1712 to 1743; in 1742 to 1765; in 1763 to 1786; in 1781 to 1812;
    and so on. There have been times of tightness. In 1697 the Bank was
    forced to suspend partially payment in coin, giving 10 per cent once
    a fortnight, and afterwards at the rate of 3 per cent once in three
    months. In 1720 it escaped the disaster of the South Sea Bubble. In
    1745, when London was thrown into a panic by the approach of the
    Pretender, there was a run upon the Bank. This was staved off by paying
    slowly in silver. In the year 1797, by an order in Council, last
    payments were suspended. These events, however, belong to the after
    history of the Bank.
  </p>

  <p>
    The foundation of the Bank of England brought about a complete
    revolution in the relations of Crown and City. We have seen that
    hitherto the City was called the King’s Chamber; when the King wanted
    money he sent to the City for a loan; sometimes he asked more than the
    City could lend; generally the City readily conceded the loan.
  </p>

  <p>
    In a note, Sharpe calls attention to the absurdity of representing the
    Chancellor of the Exchequer going about, hat in hand, borrowing £100 of
    this hosier and £100 from that ironmonger:—
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “The mode of procedure was nearly always the same. The lords of
      the treasury would appear some morning before the Common Council,
      and after a few words of explanation as to the necessities of the
      time, would ask for a loan, offering in most cases undeniable
      security. Supposing that the Council agreed to raise the required
      loan, which it nearly always did, the mayor for the time being was
      usually instructed to issue his precept to the aldermen to collect
      subscriptions within their several wards, whilst other precepts
      were (in later times at least) sent to the master of wardens of
      the livery companies to do the same among the members of their
      companies. There were times, also, when the companies were called
      upon to subscribe in proportion to their assessment for supplying
      the City with corn in times of distress” (<cite>London and the Kingdom</cite>,
      vol. ii. pp. 586, 587).
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    The last loan ever asked by the King of the City was that asked by
    William the Third in 1697 to pay off his navy after the Peace of
    Utrecht. Instead of going to the City the King went to the Bank, but
    not then without the authority of Parliament. The City was no longer
    to be the Treasurer—or the Pawnbroker—of the King and the nation. This
    event, though the citizens did not apprehend its full meaning for
    many years, deprived London of that special power which had made her
    from the Norman Conquest alternately the object of the Sovereign’s
    affections or of his hatred. Henceforth it mattered nothing to London
    whether the King loved or hated her. The power of the City was now
    exercised legitimately by her representatives in the House of Commons.

      <span class="subhead">THE IRISH ESTATES</span>
    </h3>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">
    <span class="smcap">The</span> following history of the Irish estates is taken from
    <cite>London and Londonderry</cite>, published in Belfast (1890) by Messrs. Marcus Ward and Co.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the year 1608 the first steps were taken towards the settlement
    of Ulster by English and Scotch emigrants—a measure whose wisdom was
    shown eighty years later, when the grandson of James the First owed his
    expulsion largely to the descendants of the original settlers.
  </p>

  <p>
    The greater part of six counties in the Province of Ulster, viz.
    Donegal, Fermanagh, Cavan, Tyrone, Armagh, and Coleraine, after the
    rebellions of O’Neill and O’Donnell, were declared to be escheated to
    the Crown. James conceived a plan for securing the peace and welfare of
    Ulster by replacing the Irish rebels by Protestant settlers, together
    with those of the Irish who were willing to conform to the English rule
    and religion. He therefore invited “undertakers” who would accept of
    lands in Ulster on his conditions.
  </p>

  <p>
    These were, that they should not ask for large portions “in tending
    their private property only;” that there should be three classes of
    undertakers:
  </p>

  <p>(1) Those who would plant with English or Scotch tenants.</p>

  <p>(2) Servitors or military undertakers.</p>

  <p>(3) Native Irish admitted as freeholders.</p>

  <p>
    The first class were to pay to the Crown the great rent of £5:6:8 for
    every thousand acres. The second class, when they planted with English
    or Scotch tenants, were to pay the same; otherwise, the second class
    were to pay £8 for every thousand acres; and the third class were to
    pay £10:13:4 for every thousand acres.
  </p>

  <p>
    The third condition was, that all were required to provide strongholds
    and arms for defence, to let their lands on easy terms, to “avoid Irish
    exactions,” and to be resident; they were not to accept the “mere”
    Irish as tenants at all; they were required to create market towns,
    and to found at least one free school in every county for education in
    religion and learning. They were also privileged to
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span> import from Great
    Britain for three years, free of custom, everything requisite to put
    the plantation on a satisfactory footing.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 1609 Commissioners were appointed to survey the escheated lands and
    to divide them into convenient parcels for allocation.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the same year proposals were made in the King’s name to the City
    that the Corporation itself should undertake the restoration of the
    city of Derry and the town of Coleraine, and should plant the rest
    of the county with undertakers. The City was offered the Customs for
    twenty-one years at 6s. 8d. per annum, the fisheries of the Bann and
    the Foyle, free license to export wares grown on their own land, and
    the admiralty of Tyrconnel and Coleraine.
  </p>

  <p>The following were the inducements held out to the City:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “If multitudes of men were employed proportionally to these
      commodities which might be there by industry attained, many
      thousands would be set on work to the great service of the King,
      strength of his realm, advancement of several trades, and benefit
      of particular persons, whom the infinite increasing greatness
      (that often doth minister occasion of ruin to itself) of this
      city might not only conveniently spare, but also reap a singular
      commodity by easing themselves of an insupportable burthen which so
      surcharged all the parts of the city that one tradesman can scarce
      live by another, which in all probability would be a means also
      and preserve the city from infection; and by consequence the whole
      kingdom, of necessity, must have recourse thither, which persons
      pestered or closed up together can neither otherwise or very hardly
      avoid” (<cite>London and Londonderry</cite>, p. 7).
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    On July 1, 1609, the Court of Aldermen sent a precept to each of the
    City Companies asking them to appoint representatives to consider the
    propositions. The Companies refused to undertake this work. Thereupon
    the Mayor appointed a Committee, ignoring the refusal of the Companies,
    to carry out the undertaking. This Committee sent an order to the
    Companies to ascertain what each member would willingly undertake.
  </p>

  <p>
    On August 1, 1609, the City sent out four “viewers” to survey the
    place intended for the new Plantation and “to make report to this
    City.” The viewers returned in December, when it was resolved that
    £15,000 should be raised to meet preliminary expenses. The money was
    to be raised <em>in</em> the Companies, not by the Companies. Meantime the
    City asked for certain additional advantages, including forces for
    defence to be maintained at the King’s charges. It was agreed that 200
    houses should be built at Derry, leaving room for 300 more, and that
    100 houses should be built at Coleraine, leaving room for 200 more,
    and that fortifications should be constructed. Another sum of £5000
    was then ordered to be raised. In January 1610 the demands of the City
    were granted by the Privy Council. It is important to observe that the
    “undertaking” by the City was not a purchase by the Companies, but
    taxation of the members of the Companies by order of the City, just as
    any other tax was imposed and collected. Some of the poorer Companies
    were exempted, but not the “abler” men among them.
  </p>

  <p>
    In July 1611 another contribution of £20,000 was raised by tax. In
    this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
    case those Companies which might choose to lose the benefits
    resulting from their previous contributions were exempt—a privilege
    accepted by two of the Companies.
  </p>

  <p>
    Power was given by the Common Council to the Committee of the
    Corporation, afterwards the Irish Society, to divide the land among
    those Companies willing to accept them, and so “to build and plant the
    same at their own cost and charges, accordingly as by the Printed Book
    of Plantation is required.” Eight of the great Companies accepted at
    once, and the other four shortly afterwards.
  </p>

  <p>
    Meantime the Privy Council made certain conditions, among them the
    following:—
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “The Londoners are <em>first</em> to provide habitations for such poor
      and necessary men as they draw thither for their business, and
      afterwards to let for such rents as shall be fitting <em>as well for
      the good of the Plantation</em> as for some valuable rent
      (<span class="smcap">the charges considered</span>), <em>the Londoners
      always performing the Articles of Plantation</em>” (<cite>London and
      Londonderry</cite>, pp. 12, 13).
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    It would appear from this that the subscribers were intended to get
    rent in return for their outlay, but they never did, because the
    Companies added the rents of the land to their own corporate funds. As
    the subscribers do not appear to have objected, this was probably done
    openly and without any remonstrance or objection.
  </p>

  <p>
    Complaints began to be made that the conditions were not carried out;
    only twenty houses were built at Derry instead of the 200 promised; the
    Londoners were converting the timber to their own profit. In December
    1612 the King wrote to Sir Arthur Chichester, the Lord Deputy:—
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “‘If there were no reason of State to press it forward, yet we
      would pursue and effect that work with the same earnestness, merely
      for the goodness and morality of it, esteeming the settling of
      religion, the introducing of civility, order, and government among
      a barbarous and unsubjected people to be the acts of piety and
      glory, and worthy also a Christian Prince to endeavour’” (<cite>London
      and Londonderry</cite>, p. 13).
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    On March 29, 1613, the first charter was granted to the Irish Society
    as representing not the Companies, but the Corporation of the City of
    London for the Plantations. This charter constitutes and incorporates
    the Irish Society:—
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “‘For the better ordering, directing, and governing all and all
      manner of things for and concerning the City and Citizens of
      Londonderry aforesaid, and the aforesaid County of Londonderry,
      and the Plantation to be made within the same City and County
      of Londonderry, and other businesses belonging to the same,’
      giving the Society power to purchase and hold in fee, <em>for these
      purposes</em>, lands, goods, etc., in England or in Ireland, to have a
      common seal, and to sue or be sued” (p. 14).
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    A grant of timber is made only for the Plantation and “not for any
    other causes to be merchandized or sold.” In other words, the Irish
    Society was incorporated for the purpose of a Trust; the members were
    originally Trustees.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is charged against the Society that they began by neglecting the
    conditions, setting too high a rent upon their lands, and trying to
    make a profit for the Londoners out of the property. James himself was
    much dissatisfied with the conduct of the estates. He wrote to Sir
    Arthur again in August 1615, adding a
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span> postscript in his own hand:—“My
    Lord, in this service I expect that zeal and uprightness from you, that
    you will spare no flesh, English or Scotch, for no private man’s worth
    is able to counterbalance the particular safety of a kingdom, which
    this Plantation, being well accomplished, will procure.”
  </p>

  <p>
    A year afterwards the King granted a licence to the twelve Companies to
    hold in mortmain whatever lands the Irish Society might grant them.
  </p>

  <p>
    These grants contained a reservation of the right of re-entry if the
    conditions specified were not kept.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is, of course, evident that if the Irish Society were Trustees they
    could not give away their lands, and that they could only make grants
    under the conditions of their Trust.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 1620, on further complaints being made, the sequestration of the
    estates was granted, but not carried out. In 1624 other complaints were
    made that the conditions of allotting 4000 acres to Derry and 3000
    to Coleraine had not been carried out. It was replied that Derry had
    received 1500 and Coleraine 500.
  </p>

  <p>
    Charles I. began by making an attempt to fix a fair rent, which
    appears to have failed, the Society declaring that for the time it was
    impracticable. There were, no doubt, difficulties in the way of getting
    settlers, or, which seems possible, there were so many applicants that
    the Society was able to run up rents. In 1637 the Court of Chancery
    gave judgment in the case. The letters patent of March 1613 were
    annulled, and the premises granted to the Irish Society were seized
    into the hands of the King. A fine of £70,000 was also imposed upon the
    City.
  </p>

  <p>The charges brought against the Londoners were as follows:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “1st, Unduly and deceitfully obtaining the letters patent, ‘under
      pretence of a due observance of the articles’; 2nd, Obtaining
      more land than it was the King’s intention to grant (97,000
      acres of fertile land, instead of 27,000), the rents mentioned
      being ‘one hundred and ninety-three pounds, eight shillings and
      fourpence, and no more;’ 3rd, The neglecting to plant with English
      and inland Scots, and illegally many of the ‘mere Irish’ (names
      being given) in possession of the lands; 4th, Rack-renting of an
      atrocious type. ‘Their Agents ... do still continue the natives
      upon the said Plantation, and paid the Fines imposed upon them,
      according to the said Proclamation, for not departing from the
      British undertaken Lands, <em>because they would give greater Rents
      for the said Lands than the British were able to live upon</em>, and
      did prefer the Irish before the English, because they pretended
      they were more serviceable unto them, by which means,
      <span class="smcap">and by their excessive raising the rents from
      forty shillings and fifty shillings a balliboe, unto ten pounds,
      twelve pounds, and twenty pounds and thirty pounds a balliboe</span>,
      the English were and
      are much disheartened, and the natives do far exceed the British,
      etc.;’ 5th, Spoliation of the Plantation and fraud on the Crown by
      cutting down the woods <em>for merchandise</em> instead of for Plantation
      purposes to the extent of one million oaks, two thousand elms, and
      two hundred thousand ash trees, of the value of £550,666 13s. 4d.”
      (pp. 21 and 22).
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    The King, however, accepted a fine of £12,000 with the surrender of all
    the grants.
  </p>

  <p>
    Three years later the sentence of the Court was set aside by the House
    of Commons with the following resolutions:—
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “Resolved that it is the opinion of this House that the Citizens
      of London were solicited and pressed to the Undertaking of the
      Plantation of Londonderry.
    </p>

    <p>
      Resolved, that the Copy attested by Mr. Goad’s Hand is a true Copy
      of the Sentence given in the Star-Chamber against the Mayor and
      Commonalty of the City of London, and of the new plantation of
      Ulster in the Kingdom of Ireland.
    </p>

    <p>
      Resolved, That the Order made in the Court of Star-Chamber, dated
      the eighth of March, in the eighth of Charles, is unlawful, both
      for the Matter, Persons, and Time therein prefixed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Resolved, That this House is of Opinion that the King was not
      deceived in the grant which he made unto the Society of Governors
      and Assistants of London of the new Plantation of Ulster in
      the Kingdom of Ireland, in particular; nor in creating a new
      Corporation, called the Society of the Governors and Assistants of
      London of the new Plantation of Ulster in the Kingdom of Ireland.
    </p>

    <p>
      Resolved, That this House is of Opinion that the King did not by
      that patent grant more Land than was by him intended to be granted,
      nor was he therein deceived.
    </p>

    <p>
      That it doth not appear by sufficient Proof that the Citizens of
      London were tied to perform the printed Articles, and consequently
      not bound to plant with English and Scots, nor restrained from
      planting with Natives.
    </p>

    <p>
      By the seven-and-twenty Articles, the City was to build two hundred
      Houses in Derry, and an hundred at Coleraine by the first Day of
      November 1611. Admitting that the Houses were not built, nor the
      Castle of Culmore repaired, by the time prefixed; yet this is no
      Crime, nor Cause for giving Damages, in regard the City had not
      that Patent until the nine-and-twentieth of March 1613.
    </p>

    <p>
      That there is no Proof that the Governor, etc., of the new
      Plantation, or any of their Companies, did make any Lease unto any
      Popish Recusant, nor of any Decay of Religion there by default of
      the Planters.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is no Proof of any Default in the Planters for not making a
      sufficient Number of Freeholders, nor any Articles that do tie them
      thereunto.
    </p>

    <p>
      That there is no proof that the City of London, or the Governor
      of the new Plantations, have felled any trees in the Woods called
      Glancankin and Kellytrough, contrary to their covenant.
    </p>

    <p>
      That the not conveying of Glebe Lands to the several Incumbents of
      the several Parish Churches, in regard their did enjoy the Lands,
      is no Crime punishable, nor cause of Seizure of their Lands.
    </p>

    <p>
      That the Breach of Covenant (if any such were) is no sufficient
      Cause to forfeit the Lands.
    </p>

    <p>
      That the Breach of Covenant is no Crime, but triable in ordinary
      Courts of Justice.
    </p>

    <p>
      That the Court of Star-Chamber, while it stood as a Court, had no
      Power to examine Freehold nor Inheritance; nor had any Power to
      examine or determine Breach of Covenant or Trust.
    </p>

    <p>
      That the Sentence upon these Corporations aggregate, no particular
      Person being guilty, it is against Law.
    </p>

    <p>
      That in all the Proofs of this Cause there doth not appear Matter
      sufficient to convince the City of London of any Crime.
    </p>

    <p>
      That, upon the whole Matter, the Sentence of the Star-Chamber was
      unlawful and unjust.
    </p>

    <p>
      That this Composition and Agreement made with the City upon these
      Terms in the Time of Extremity ought not to bind the City.
    </p>

    <p>
      That the Opinion of the House is, That they think fit, that both
      the Citizens of London, and those of the new Plantation, and
      all Under-Tenants, and all those put out of Possession by the
      Sequestration, or King’s Commissioners, shall be restored to the
      same State they were in before the Sentence in the Star-Chamber.
    </p>

    <p>
      That the Citizens of London, and all they against whom the
      Judgement is given in the Scire Facias, shall be discharged of that
      Judgement.”
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    In 1650 Oliver Cromwell made a new grant of the estates to the City. In
    1662 a great charter was granted by Charles II. This charter restored
    the Irish Society, with the same powers of management as had been
    granted in 1613 with all the former conditions and reservations. The
    management of these lands by a Committee in London, quite ignorant of
    the place and the people, and wholly dependent upon reports of their
    servants, presented difficulties and dangers which, to us, are obvious.
    But it was an age for creating companies and enterprises all governed
    by Committees from London, and some of them so well governed, that
    the plan seemed feasible and convenient for all companies. Ireland,
    however, was a more difficult country than Hudson’s Bay or East India.
  </p>

 <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span></p>

  <p>
    The election of members of the Irish Society after this new charter
    became practically the appointment on the Board of representatives
    of the Companies concerned. There were two permanent and official
    members, the Governor of the Society and the Recorder of London; the
    other twenty-four were appointed by the Corporation. The Society
    became, therefore, quite naturally, the servant of the Companies, the
    responsibilities of the trust were forgotten or neglected, and the
    custom arose of dividing among the Companies whatever surplus remained
    after the management expenses had been paid.
  </p>

  <p>
    The management of the estates by the Irish Society is a chapter which
    belongs rather to the history of Ulster than to that of London. The
    case against the Society is simply that, instead of exercising a trust
    for the benefit of the estates, they acted as landlords for the benefit
    of the Companies.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the year 1830 the Corporation began to elect members of the Irish
    Society from the whole body of freemen. The first result was that
    the Companies lost the division of the surplus from the undivided
    estate. The Skinners’ Company brought an action in the Court of
    Chancery intended to force the Irish Society to become Trustees for the
    Companies of all the rents and profits of the undivided estate.
  </p>

  <p>
    The case was decided against the Skinners; they appealed; again
    judgment went against them; they took the case up to the Lords. It was
    a third time given against them.
  </p>

  <p>
    The judgment of Lord Langdale, Master of the Rolls, when the case came
    before him, contained the following strong opinions:—
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “‘It is, I think, impossible to read and consider the charter
      without coming to the conclusion that the powers granted to the
      society were more extensive than, and very different from, any
      which in the ordinary course of affairs are vested, or would upon
      this occasion have been vested, in mere private Trustees for the
      benefit of particular undertakers. The powers indeed are, many of
      them, of a public and political nature, and ... were given for
      the public purposes of the Plantation.... The Companies of London
      were, with the burthen of undertaking the plantation of such lands
      as might be allotted to them, to receive such benefits as were
      offered to ... ordinary undertakers.... The Charter of Charles
      appears to me to be substantially, as it is avowedly, a restoration
      of the Charter of James. The property is part of that granted for
      the purposes of the Plantation, and the powers possessed by the
      Society, as well as the duties with which it is charged, <i>have all
      of them reference to the Plantation</i>.
      <span class="smcap">I am of opinion that the
        powers granted to the society, and the trusts reposed in them, were
        in part of a general and public nature, independent of the private
        benefit of the companies of london, and were intended by the crown
        to benefit ireland, and the city of london, by connecting the
        city of londonderry <span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
        and the town of coleraine and a considerable
        irish district with the city of london, and to promote the general
        purposes of the plantation, not only by securing the performance
        of the conditions imposed on ordinary undertakers, but also by the
        exercise of powers and the performance of trusts not within the
        scope of those conditions
      </span>’” (pp. 44, 45).
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Since this decision the Irish Society has remained untouched. After the
    Report of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Livery Companies of
    London, a Bill was prepared on lines indicated by this Report, but the
    Bill did not pass into law.

  <p class="noindent">
    <span class="smcap">The</span> Plague of 1603, which is said to have swept away 30,578 persons,
    is one of the four great plagues of London of the seventeenth century.
    Historians, in their desire to account for these visitations, talk
    glibly about the sanitary arrangements of the City, the scant supply of
    good water, the crowded houses, and so forth as helping to spread the
    Plague. No doubt these things did help and encourage the visitation.
    Let us point out, however, that the City a hundred years after the
    plague of 1666—say, in 1766—was far more crowded than at that time,
    that its sanitary arrangements were no better, and that the people,
    though the New River water was laid on, continued to drink the water
    of the City wells (not, certainly, so many as before the fire), which
    received the filtrations and the pollutions of a hundred and fifty
    burial-grounds. They also continued their cess-pools, their narrow
    lanes, and their kennels filled with refuse of all kinds. Yet in the
    eighteenth century there was no plague. Let us also point out that
    parts of all great cities in Europe were, and are still, extremely
    crowded and filthy, yet no plague. In other words, it is dangerous to
    be unwashed, but not in itself a sufficient cause of plague. There must
    have been causes, of which one knows nothing, why the Plague should
    take hold of the City on four separate occasions in one century, and
    after devastating it on a grand scale, should go away for good. All
    the precautions observed in 1666 are recorded to have been taken in
    1603. Women who had to do with the sick and the dead, if they went
    abroad, carried in their hands a red staff, so that people gave them
    a wide berth. Warnings were issued against attending funerals; dogs
    were killed; infected houses were marked with a red cross; streets were
    cleansed; bonfires were lit at street corners; the grave-diggers and
    the conductors of the dead carts did their work with the protection of
    tobacco; a thick cover of earth was laid upon the dead. The people,
    thrown out of work by thousands, were relieved and maintained by the
    Corporation and the City Companies.
  </p>

  <p>
    There exists a strange and whimsical account of this plague entitled
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
    <cite>The Wonderful Yeare 1603</cite>. The writer has no intention of setting
    down a plain unvarnished tale, as will be seen from the following
    extracts (<cite>Phœnix Britannicus</cite>):—
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “A stiffe and freezing horror sucks up the rivers of my blood;
      my haire stands on ende with the panting of my braines: mine eye
      balls are ready to start out, being beaten with the billowes of
      my teares: out of my weeping pen does the ink mournfully and more
      bitterly than gall drop on the pale-faced paper, even when I do
      but thinke how the bowels of my sicke country have been torne.
      <i>Apollo</i>, therefore, and you bewitching silver-tongued <i>Muses</i>, get
      you gone: I invocate none of your names. Sorrow and truth, sit you
      on each side of me, whilst I am delivered of this deadly burden:

      arme my trembling hand, that I may boldly rip up and anatomize
      the ulcerous body of this <i>Anthropophagized Plague</i>: lend me art
      (without any counterfeit shadowing) to paint and delineate to the
      life the whole story of this mortall and pestiferous battaile. And
      you the ghosts of those more (by many) than 40,000, that with the
      virulent poison of infection have been driven out of your earthly
      dwellings: you desolate hand-wringing widowes, that beate your
      bosomes over your departing husbandes: you wofully distracted
      mothers that with dishevelled hair fall into swounds, while you
      lie kissing the insensible cold lips of your breathless infants:
      you outcast and downtrodden orphans, that shall many a yeare hence
      remember more freshly to mourne, when your mourning garments shall
      look old and be forgotten: and you the Genii of all those emptyed
      families, whose habitations are now among the Antipodes: joine
      all your hands together, and with your bodies cast a ring about
      me: let me behold your ghastly vizages, that my paper may receive
      their true pictures and eccho forth your grones through the hollow
      trunke of my pen, and rain down your gummy tears into mine incke,
      that even marble bosomes may be shaken with terrour, and hearts of
      adamant melt into compassion.”

  <p>He goes on to describe the many who ran away:—</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “It was no boot to bid them take their heels, for away they trudge
      thick and threefold: some riding, some on foote, some without
      bootes, some in their slippers, by water, by land, swom they
      westward: many to Gravesend none went unless they were driven: for
      whosoever landed there never came back again. Hacknies, water-men,
      and wagons were not so terribly employed many a year: so that
      within a short time there was not a good horse in Smithfield, nor a
      coach to be set eye on: for after the world had once run upon the
      wheeles of the pest cart, neither coach nor caroach durst appeare
      in his likenesse. Let us pursue these run-awayes no longer, but
      leave them in the unmercifull hands of the country-hardheaded
      Hobbinolls (who are ordained to be their tormentors), and return
      back to the siege of the citie.

      boxt into every corner, and yet were both drunke every hour at
      other men’s cost. Lazarus lay groaning at every man’s door: marry
      no Dives was within to send him a crum (for all your Gold-finches

      they (like Curres) were knockt downe like oxen, and fell thicker

      of three thousand trooping together: husbands, wives, and children
      being led as ordinarily to one grave as if they had gone to one
      bed. And those that could shift for a time, and shrink their heads
      out of the collar (as many did) yet went they most bitterly miching

      eares and nostrils, looking like so many bores’ heads stuck with
      branches of rosemary, to be served in for brawne at Christmas. This
      was a rare world for the Church, who had wont to complaine for
      want of living, and now had more living thrust upon her than she
      knew how to bestow: to have been clarke now to a parish clarke was
      better than to serve some foolish justice of peace, or than the

    The Plague first made its appearance in the East End; it raged at
    Gravesend. On the alarm of its spreading all those who could took
    flight; those who were left behind were the working-men, craftsmen,
    journeymen, and servants, who lost their work and their wages. Among
    the fugitives were the physicians, whose place was taken by quacks; and
    in the City there perished many thousands, sometimes whole families
    dying in a single house; sometimes poor wretches lying down to die
    in the street or under a stall; in a word, all the horrors of such a
    visitation with which Defoe has made the world familiar.

  <p>
    Twenty-one years later, on the accession of Charles, the Plague
    returned, and, continuing for a year, carried off 35,417 persons in
    London alone. I mention it in this place because the same writer,
    Benjamin Spencer, who gave us <cite>The Wonderful Yeare</cite> lived to write in
    1625 <cite>Vox Civitatis</cite>, the Lament of London. The City complains that her
    children have infected the air with their sins; we need not enumerate
    the sins; in this respect every city is conservative. These and not the
    stinks of the City, not the reeking shambles, the noisome kennel, the
    malarious laystall are the cause of the Plague. Nor is her trouble only
    caused by sickness and death of multitudes:—
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “This is not all my trouble, for my sorrows are increased like
      my sins: sickness hath consumed my substance: and with David, I
      justly say, I am weak and poor. My poverty lieth in being void of
      Trade, Money and victual. All which I am well nigh destitute of
      at this time. This I confess to be justly inflicted on me for my
      Pride, with which I have sought to outface Heaven. My tinckling
      feet, and my tip-toe Pace, my horned Tyaras, and crisp-curled
      locks, Shin-pride, and shoe-pride. Fulness of Bread hath made me
      lift my heel against my Maker, I said in my prosperity I should
      never be moved: but Thou, O Lord, hast turned Thy face, and I am
      troubled. My children have been so full-fed, that they have fallen
      out among themselves, the meanest thinking himself as good as the
      Magistrate, and the mighty refusing to look upon the cause of the
      mean. My Merchants have been the companions of Princes, but now
      are gone; their place is scarce to be found. How hath my back
      groaned with heavy burdens: and now Issacher stands still for want
      of work. One Waine may carry all I sell in a day. I have had such
      trading, that I could scarce find time to serve God, but now every
      day is a holiday, because I have prophaned His holy day (even His
      blessed Sabbath) which hath been dedicated to Him, as a remembrance
      of His glorious resurrection. But I have laid dead in sins and
      trespasses. I have given liberty to my servants to execute their
      wills in Sabbath breaking and deceiving: now God hath proclaimed
      liberty for them to the pestilence, to wandering, and to idleness.
      My apprentices have been the children of knights, and justices of
      the country (which they accepted at my hands joyfully), but now
      my children are cast out by those Swines like dung, rated like
      Beggars, served like swine in Hogsties, buried in the Highway like
      Malefactors.”

  <p>
    With a great deal more, from which we perceive that the same things
    happened in 1625 as in 1603. Aldermen, Common Councilmen, Magistrates,
    Physicians, Lawyers, Clergymen, all ran away, and among the dying sat
    the children not yet infected, crying for bread. It would seem—a fact
    that I have not elsewhere observed—that they turned the rooms over
    the City gates into hospitals or receiving houses for the children,
    doubtless the orphaned children.

  <p>
    Besides the two visitations of Plague already mentioned, there were in
    the seventeenth century two more, viz. in 1636 and 1665, the first of
    these occurring after an interval of no more than five years since the
    preceding one. The deaths from Plague for these four visitations were
    as follows; the numbers must be taken as approximate only:—
  </p>

  <p class="noindent">
    <span class="ml20">In 1603 there died of Plague 30,561 persons.</span><br />
    <span class="ml20">&nbsp;„&nbsp;1625&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;„&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;„&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;35,417&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;„</span><br />
    <span class="ml20">&nbsp;„&nbsp;1636&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;„&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;„&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10,400&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;„</span><br />
    <span class="ml20">&nbsp;„&nbsp;1665&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;„&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;„&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;68,596&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;„</span>
  </p>

  <p>
    That is to say, in sixty-three years there died 144,974 persons of
    Plague alone. There were, however, many more victims, because between
    1603 and 1636 the Plague was hardly ever absent. The deaths from Plague
    every year ranged from 1000 to 4000, though in one or two years there
    were none.
  </p>

  <p>
    For the greatest and last visitation, that of 1665, we have, besides
    the graphic account of Defoe, also the more sober notices of Pepys
    and Evelyn. There were warnings of the approach of the Plague. In the
    autumn of 1663 it was reported to be raging in Amsterdam; ships from
    Holland were placed in quarantine; in December 1664 one person died
    of Plague in London; in February 1665 another death was reported; in
    April there were two; in May the number began to increase, running up
    to nine, fourteen, and forty-three. The summer of 1665 was extremely
    hot; an unclouded sky continued for weeks; there was no rain to wash
    the streets; there was no wind to refresh the air; if the people made
    bonfires to create a draught, it was observed that the flame and
    smoke mounted straight up. In June all those who could escape to the
    country left the town in whatsoever vehicles they could get—coaches,
    carriages, waggons, and carts. There was a general stampede, until the
    villagers stopped it, driving back the people with pitch-forks, and
    the Lord Mayor stopped it by refusing certificates of health. Then,
    the mortality rising daily by leaps and bounds, the people sat down
    in their houses to die, or wandered disconsolately about the desolate
    streets, marking the crosses on the doors with sinking hearts.
  </p>

  <p>
    It must be observed that the Lord Mayor, the Sheriffs, and the
    Aldermen remained at their posts, that the Archbishop of Canterbury
    remained at Lambeth, and that the Duke of Albemarle and Lord Craven
    remained in their town houses; the Court, however, went away, and the
    judges removed their courts to Oxford.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span> The physicians excused their
    flight by the plea that they accompanied their patients, and the City
    clergy—those who ran away—that they had followed their flocks.

  <p>
    There was no trade or craft of any kind carried on; shops, warehouses,
    offices, quays were closed or deserted; ships that arrived laden
    remained unnoticed in the Pool; the craftsmen and the common people
    had no work and drew no wages; servants and apprentices were thrust
    into the street; except for food there was nothing bought or sold;
    the quays, the port, the streets were silent; there was no grumbling
    of the broad wheels of waggons; there were no street cries; there
    were no bells; there were no children shouting and running about the
    streets. The churches, deserted by their incumbents, were taken over by
    Nonconformist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
    ministers. It was contrary to law, but at such a time
    who cared for law? These preachers, braver than their persecutors,
    exhorted fearlessly crowded congregations, catching at every word
    of consolation or hope; quacks of the basest kind issued their
    advertisements, professing to cure the Plague. All kinds of ridiculous
    remedies were tried; plague water, amulets, hot spices, cupping
    glasses, besides old mediæval nostrums, all these were advocated and
    proved futile. The parishes which suffered most were St. Giles in the
    Fields; St. Andrew’s, Holborn; St. Clement Danes; St. Martin’s in
    the Fields, and Westminster. When the disease abated in those parts
    it broke out with equal force in Cripplegate, St. Sepulchre’s; St.
    James’s, Clerkenwell; St. Bride’s, and St. Botolph’s, Aldersgate. The
    City was divided into districts, each with surgeons, nurses, watchers,
    and grave-diggers; infected houses were closed; their doors were marked
    with a red cross a foot long; the grave-diggers removed the bodies of
    those who died in the streets; in the night the cart went round to
    collect the dead; the bodies were thrown into <i xml:lang="la">fosses communes</i>, or
    common graves, either in the parish churchyard or some place set apart
    outside the town. There were hospitals erected called Pest Houses,
    one in Tothill Fields and one in Old Street; but those were only for
    people who could afford to pay. In a tract entitled “God’s terrible
    voice to the City,” by the Rev. Thomas Vincent, there is a picture, not
    overdrawn, of the City in August when the Plague was at its worst:—
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “In August how dreadful is the increase! Now the cloud is very
      black, and the storm comes down upon us very sharp. Now death rides
      triumphantly on his pale horse through our streets, and breaks
      into every house where any inhabitants are to be found. Now people
      fall as thick as the leaves in autumn when they are shaken by a
      mighty wind. Now there is a dismal solitude in London streets:
      every day looks with the face of a Sabbath day, observed with a
      greater solemnity than it used to be in the City. Now shops are
      shut, people rare and very few that walk about, insomuch that the
      grass begins to spring up in some places; there is a deep silence
      in every street, especially within the walls. No prancing horses,
      no rattling coaches, no calling on customers nor offering wares, no
      London cries sounding in the ears. If any voice be heard it is the
      groans of dying persons breathing forth their last, and the funeral
      knells of them that are ready to be carried to their graves. Now
      shutting up of visited houses (there being so many) is at an end,
      and most of the well are mingled amongst the sick, which otherwise
      would have got no help. Now, in some places, where the people did
      generally stay, not one house in a hundred but what is affected:
      and in many houses half the family is swept away: in some, from the
      eldest to the youngest: few escape but with the death of one or
      two. Never did so many husbands and wives die together: never did
      so many parents carry their children with them to the grave, and
      go together into the same house under earth who had lived together
      in the same house upon it. Now the nights are too short to bury
      the dead: the whole day, though at so great a length, is hardly
      sufficient to light the dead that fall thereon into their graves.”
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    During this terrible time, when all work was suspended, the people
    were only kept from starving by munificent gifts. The King gave £1000
    a week; the City £600 a week; the Archbishop of Canterbury many
    hundreds every week; there was the whole industrial population of the
    City to be provided for. Some got employment from the Corporation as
    watchmen, grave-diggers, searchers, and the like; most had no work
    and no wages; their insufficient nourishment no doubt assisted the
    disease, which raged with the greatest force among the poorer sort.
    Bartholomew Fair was forbidden. In September Pepys writes, “To Lambeth:
    but Lord! what a sad time it is, to see no boats upon the river, and
    grass grows all up and down Whitehall Court, and nobody but wretches
    in the street.” The people began to get back and to go about their
    usual business in December; the Court returned in February, and it
    was soon observed that the streets were as full of people as ever.
    Yet nearly 70,000 had fallen, or perhaps one in three. If with the
    present population of 5,000,000 one in three were to die of Plague
    there would be a loss of 1,700,000. It seems as if about a third part
    of the population of London were cut off by this scourge. Happily it
    was the last of the great plagues. The history of London is no longer
    interrupted by the death of one-third of its people.

  <p>
    It will be observed that the Plague lingered until the Great Fire of
    September 2 drove it clean away.
  </p>

  <p>
    The best—that is, the most graphic—account of the Plague is that of
    Daniel Defoe. It is, perhaps, too long. The mind grows sick in the
    reading. He presents us, after his favourite method, with a series of
    pictures and portraits of individuals. When it is remembered that his
    book appeared in the year 1720, the year, that is, of the great Plague
    of Marseilles, and fifty-five years after the event, it is generally
    believed that his history is a work of pure fiction. I think it can be
    shown, however, that it was not a work of fiction at all, but simply a
    work of recollection. To the old man of sixty came back the memories
    and the tales that he had heard as a boy not yet in his teens.
  </p>

  <p>
    Defoe was born in the year 1661. His father lived in Cripplegate,
    where, as we know, he had a shop. The child, therefore, was four years
    of age in the Plague year. A child of four observes a great deal and
    may remember a great deal. Children vary very much in respect to
    observation and memory. For instance, a child would remember, perhaps,
    anything out of the common in the buying and selling of goods in
    his father’s shop, where he looked on at the customers. Defoe says:
    “When anyone bought a joint of meat, he would not take it out of the
    butcher’s hand, but took it off the hooks himself; on the other hand,
    the butcher would not touch the money, but put it into a pot full of
    vinegar which he kept for that purpose. The buyer carried always small
    money to make up any odd sum, so that he might take no change.” This
    must surely have been seen by the child and remembered. It happened
    in his own father’s shop before his eyes. Another thing. The Great
    Fire not only drove the lingering Plague out of the City, but actually
    drove away the memory of it. Who could talk or think about the Plague
    with this other awful affliction to consider? Now Cripplegate—where
    the child Defoe lived—was not touched by the Fire; it was very heavily
    afflicted by the Plague, but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
    Fire spared it. Therefore to the
    people of Cripplegate the Plague continued as the chief incident in
    their lives; they continued to talk of their adventures, their escapes,
    their sufferings, and their bereavements long after the people within
    the walls had left off thinking of theirs. And the boy grew up amid
    such talk. Therefore he was never allowed to forget his childish
    impressions. The awful silence in the streets, save for the shrieks
    and groans of the plague-stricken; the rumbling of the burial carts at
    night; the houses deserted, infected, no longer marked but left with
    open doors ready for the robber who roamed about with impunity till
    Death seized him and he fell; the poor wretch, gone mad with terror and
    suffering and bereavement, moaning and crying in the street; the closed
    shops; the poor creatures sitting down in any porch or on any stall to
    die—all these things were told to the boy over and over again, until
    they were burned into his brain, to be reproduced in the most wonderful
    account of a plague that has ever been written. Therefore, and for this
    reason, Defoe’s <cite>History</cite> is a real history; the incidents are not
    invented but remembered. While we allow something for the embroidery
    of the novelist we must acknowledge that we have a contribution to the
    history of that terrible year larger, fuller, more human, than we can
    find in Pepys or in Evelyn, or in any other contemporary authority.

  <p>
    On the first appearance of the Plague of 1665 the Mayor and Aldermen
    issued orders of precaution similar to those which had been framed
    in the visitation of the year 1625. These orders are contained in a
    collection of “valuable and scarce Pieces” relating to the Plague of
    the latter year, published for J. Roberts at the Oxford Arms in Warwick
    Lane, 1721. This collection gives in full the orders of the Mayor and
    Council as follows:—
  </p>

  <p>
    “Examiners to be appointed in every Parish. First, it is thought
    Requisite, and so ordered, that in every Parish there be one, two,
    or more Persons of good Sort and Credit, chosen and appointed by the
    Alderman, his Deputy, and Common Council of every Ward, by the Name of
    Examiners, to continue in that Office the space of two Months at least:
    And if any fit Person so appointed, shall refuse to undertake the same,
    the said Parties so refusing to be committed to Prison until they shall
    conform themselves accordingly.
  </p>

  <p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Examiner’s Office</span></p>

  <p>
    “That these Examiners be sworn by the Aldermen, to enquire and learn
    from time to time what Houses in every Parish be Visited, and what
    Persons be Sick, and of what Diseases, as near as they can inform
    themselves; and upon doubt in that Case, to command Restraint of
    Access, until it appear what the Disease shall prove; And if they find
    any Person sick of the Infection, to give order to the Constable that
    the House be shut up; and if the Constable shall be found Remiss or
    Negligent to give present Notice thereof to the Alderman of the Ward.
  </p>

  <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Watchmen</span></p>

  <p>
    “That to every infected House there be appointed two Watchmen, one for
    every Day, and the other for the Night; and that these Watchmen have
    a special care that no Person go in or out of such infected Houses,
    whereof they have the Charge, upon pain of severe Punishment. And the
    said Watchman to do such further offices as the sick House shall need
    and require: and if the Watchman be sent upon any Business, to lock up
    the House, and take the Key with him; And the Watchman by Day to attend
    until ten of the Clock at Night; and the Watchman by Night until six in
    the Morning.
  </p>

  <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Searchers</span></p>

  <p>
    “That there be a special care to appoint Women-Searchers in every
    Parish, such as are of honest Reputation, and of the best Sort as can
    be got in this kind: and these to be sworn to make due Search, and true
    Report to the utmost of their Knowledge, whether the Persons whose
    Bodies they are appointed to Search, do die of the Infection, or of
    what other Diseases, as near as they can. And that the Physicians who
    shall be appointed for Cure and Prevention of the Infection, do
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span> call
    before them the said Searchers, who are or shall be appointed for the
    several Parishes under their respective Cares, to the end they may
    consider whether they are fitly qualified for that Employment; and
    charge them from time to time as they shall see Cause, if they appear
    defective in their Duties.
  </p>

  <p>
    “That no Searcher during this time of Visitation, be permitted to
    use any publick Work or Employment, or keep any Shop or Stall, or be
    employed as a Laundress, or in any other common Employment whatsoever.
  </p>

  <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Chirurgeons</span></p>

  <p>
    “For better assistance of the Searchers, for as much as there hath been
    heretofore great Abuse in misreporting the Disease, to the further
    spreading of the Infection; it is therefore ordered, that there be
    chosen and appointed able and discreet Chirurgeons, besides those
    that do already belong to the Pest House: Amongst whom the City and
    Liberties to be quartered as the places lie most apt and convenient;
    and every of these to have one Quarter for his Limit; and the said
    Chirurgeons in every of their Limits to join with the Searchers for the
    View of the Body, to the end there may be a true Report made of the
    Disease.
  </p>

  <p>
    “And further, that the said Chirurgeons shall visit and search such
    like Persons as shall either send for them, or be named and directed
    unto them, by the Examiners of every Parish, and inform themselves of
    the Disease of the said Parties.
  </p>

  <p>
    “And forasmuch as the said Chirurgeons are to be sequestered from all
    other Cures, and kept only to this Disease of the Infection; it is
    ordered, That every of the said Chirurgeons shall have Twelve-pence
    a Body searched by them, to be paid out of the Goods of the Party
    searched, if he be able, or otherwise by the Parish.
  </p>

  <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Nurse-keepers</span></p>

  <p>
    “If any Nurse-keeper shall remove herself out of any infected House
    before twenty eight Days after the Decease of any Person dying of the
    Infection, the House to which the said Nurse-keeper doth so remove
    herself, shall be shut up until the said twenty eight Days be expired.
  </p>

  <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Notice to be given of the Sickness</span></p>

  <p>
    “The Master of every House, as soon as any one in his House
    complaineth, either of Botch, or Purple, or Swelling in any part of his
    Body, or falleth otherwise dangerously Sick, without apparent Cause of
    some other Disease, shall give knowledge thereof to the Examiner of
    Health within two Hours after the said Sign shall appear.

  <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sequestration of the Sick</span></p>

  <p>
    “As soon as any Man shall be found by this Examiner, Chirurgeon
    or Searcher to be sick of the Plague, he shall the same Night be
    sequestered in the same House. And in case he be so sequestered, then
    though he afterwards die not, the House wherein he sickened shall be
    shut up for a Month, after the use of the due Preservatives taken by
    the rest.
  </p>

  <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Airing the Stuff</span></p>

  <p>
    “For Sequestration of the Goods and Stuff of the Infected, their
    Bedding, and Apparel, and Hangings of Chambers, must be well aired with
    Fire, and such Perfumes as are requisite within the infected House,
    before they be taken again to use: This to be done by the Appointment
    of the Examiner.
  </p>

  <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Shutting up of the House</span></p>

  <p>
    “If any Person shall have visited any Man, known to be infected of the
    Plague, or entered willingly into any known infected House, being not
    allowed; the House wherein he inhabiteth, shall be shut up for certain
    Days by the Examiner’s Direction.
  </p>

  <p>
    “None to be removed out of infected Houses, but, etc., Item, That none
    be removed out of the House where he falleth sick of the Infection,
    into any other House in the City (except it be to the Pest-House or
    a Tent, or unto some such House, which the Owner of the said visited
    House holdeth in his own Hands, and occupieth by his own Servants),
    and so as Security be given to the Parish whither such Remove is made,
    that the Attendance and Charge about the said visited Persons shall
    be observed and charged in all the Particularities before expressed,
    without any Cost of that Parish, to which any remove shall happen to be
    made, and his Remove to be done by Night; and it shall be lawful to any
    Person that hath two Houses, to remove either his sound or his infected
    People to his spare House at his choice, so as if he send away first
    his Sound, he may not after send thither the Sick nor again unto the
    Sick the Sound. And that the same which he sendeth, be for one Week at
    the least shut up and secluded from Company for fear of some Infection,
    at the first not appearing.
  </p>

  <p class="center"><span class="smcap">Burial of the Dead</span></p>

  <p>
    “That Burial of the Dead by this Visitation, be at most convenient
    Hours, always either before Sun-rising, or after Sun-setting, with the
    Privity of the Churchwardens or Constable, and not otherwise: and that
    no Neighbours nor Friends be suffered to accompany the Corps to Church,
    or to enter the House visited, upon
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span> pain of having his House shut up,
    or be imprisoned. And that no Corps dying of Infection shall be buried,
    or remain in any Church in time of Common-Prayer, Sermon, or Lecture.
    And that no Children be suffered at time of burial of any Corps in any
    Church, Church-yard, or Burying-place to come near the Corps, Coffin,
    or Grave. And that all the Graves shall be at least six Foot deep. And
    further, all publick Assemblies at other burials are to be forborn
    during the Continuance of this Visitation.
  </p>

  <p class="center"><span class="smcap">No Infected Stuff to be Uttered</span></p>

  <p>
    “That no Clothes, Stuff, Bedding or Garments be suffered to be carried
    or conveyed out of any infected Houses, and that the Criers and
    Carriers abroad of Bedding or old Apparel to be sold or pawned, be
    utterly prohibited and restrained, and no Brokers of Bedding or old
    Apparel be permitted to make any outward Shew, or hang forth on their
    stalls, shopboards or Windows towards any Street, Lane, Common-way
    or Passage, any old Bedding or Apparel to be sold, upon pain of
    Imprisonment. And if any Broker or other Person shall buy any Bedding,
    Apparel, or other Stuff out of any infected House, within two Months
    after the Infection hath been there, his House shall be shut up as
    Infected, and so shall continue shut up twenty Days at the least.
  </p>

  <p class="center"><span class="smcap">No Person to be conveyed out of any Infected House</span></p>

    any other Means, to come, or be conveyed from a Place infected, to
    any other Place, the Parish from whence such Party hath come or been
    conveyed, upon notice thereof given, shall at their Charge cause the
    said Party so visited and escaped, to be carried and brought back again
    by Night, and the Parties in this case offending, to be punished at the
    Direction of the Alderman of the Ward: and the House of the Receiver of
    such visited Person to be shut up for twenty Days.

    The following is a contemporary account by the Rev. John Allin; it was
    published in the thirty-seventh volume of <cite>Archæologia</cite>:—
  </p>

  <p>
    “Loveing ffriend,—Yours of the 16th instant I have received and give
    you hearty thankes for that particular accompt you gave me of your
    affayres. If I can possibly gett time I thinke to write to you againe
    on Thursday: but I thought it not amiss for the inclosed’s sake, to
    write a few lines now, and to give you my thoughts of the death of
    Tolhurst’s sister. According to your description of her, there hath not
    one of those thousands yet dyed here with all the signall characters
    of this present Plague more evident than she had, which this inclosed
    will in parte confirme to you. Concerning the external effects of this
    internall infection, there are these three, with one or more or all
    of which this distemper is usually attended, botches, blaines, and
    carbuncles, to which I may add a fourth, spotts commonly called the
    tokens, and are very symtomatical never ariseing till the full state
    of the disease, even when deathe stands at the doore: for very few or
    none live that are so markt. For the botches or pestilential bubos,
    they usually aries but in 3 places, whereof the principal emunctorys of
    the body are:—behind or under the ears when the braine is afflicted;
    under each arme when the heart or vitalls are afflicted; in the groynes
    principally when the liver is afflicted. The blaines and carbuncles
    may and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
    doe aries generally in any parte of the body, necke, face,
    throate, backe, thighs, armes, leggs, etc., and all of them very
    hard: and obstinate to be dealt with withall, and must have several
    proceedings with them: and if any of them, after once appearing, either
    fall or retire backe againe, it is a very bad and dangerous symptome.
    The botches sometimes rise to a very great buiggnes, especially under
    the armes and in the groines; if so under the ears they quickly choake
    or kill with paine, there being no roome for them to bee extended: if
    they rise something in an oblongish forme, and red at the first, it is
    so much the better then if round, though as they grow to more maturity
    they will tend to a more round forme, as they come to ripen, especially
    on the topp; if they rise white it argues coldnes and want of heate and
    spot to drive them out, and must bee more carefully helpt forwards with
    internal drivers and externall drawers. The blaines rise first like
    blisters, but not puffy, as if sweld with wind or water, but hard, not
    yielding to the touch: but if they come forward to any maturity (which
    they are very difficult to bee brought to, and many dye if they have
    blaines) there will bee a very hard and knotty bunch of corrupt matter
    in them. The carbuncles, though it may be rise roundly like a pinn’s
    head, yet presently rise up to a pointed boile, very hard: sometimes
    fiery red, sometimes black, and sometimes blewish in places: red the
    best, ye others worst. All of these risings (if they be accurately
    observed at the first; but especially the carbuncles and blaines) have
    a particular symptome annexed to them, viz. they are generally circled
    about with red or blew circles, sometimes with both: sometimes they
    are broader then a bare circle, one within another: the red colour
    argue the small blood affected or choler abounding: the blewish argue
    the arteriall blood from the hearte affected; the blacke choler adust
    or melancholy: white, the potre actions of cold and crude humours
    most. For the spotts or tokens, which most generally are forrerunns of
    certain death, they do more generally this year then formerly appeare
    in divers parts of the body, formerly usually and allmost onely to
    be found upon the region of the hearte and liver, or the brest, and
    against it on the backe; but now on the necke, face, hands, armes,
    amost anywhere as well as there: sometimes as broad as farthings, these
    are called tokens: sometimes this yeare as broad as an halfecrowne:
    sometimes smaller: but always of more colours than one. If they bee
    observed at first rising sometimes with a red circle without and blew
    within: sometimes with a blew circle without and red within: sometimes
    one more bright red, the other blewish or darker, sometimes blacker:
    the blew from the arteriall, the red from the venall blood affacted,
    the blacke from melancholy as is aforesaid. Of the swellings, or mixt
    as the infection is mixed more or lesse, these usually come forth about
    the state of the disease, when nature hath done its utmost to expell
    but cannot conquer: which endeavours to expel the utmost send forth
    these external symptomes of it: and generally when these come out the
    party seemes not sick as before, but dye presently within a day or 2
    at the utmost after.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
    Many times this distemper strikes the vitalls so
    immediately, that nature hath not time to putt forth either spotts or
    blotches, and then it is the highest infection, most aptly called the
    Pestilence, and not the Plague: but done by a more immediate stroake
    of the destroying Angell. But, if such bodyes bee kept a little length
    of time after death, sometimes spoots will then arise which did not
    before, especially whilst any warmth remayne in the body: but how
    many are therefore deceived, because either they view the body onely
    immediately when dead, or bury them whilest warme: others, wickeddly to
    conceal the hands of God, will drive them in agaune, and keepe them in
    with colde and wett cloths.”

    </h3>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">
    <span class="smcap">This</span> chapter dealing with the medical literature of the Plague covers
    both the sixteenth and the seventeenth centuries, in which there was
    little change medicinally.
  </p>

  <p>
    The sixteenth century was full of plague and pestilence. In Elizabeth’s
    reign there was plague in 1563, in 1569, in 1574, in 1581, in 1592,
    and in 1603. Preventive ordinances were drawn up and issued. It
    is, however, evident that the people could not be possibly made to
    understand the necessity of caution and quarantine. The invisible
    enemy, to an ignorant folk, does not exist. The people of London bribed
    the officers, surveyors, constables, and scavengers to take down the
    “Bills” affixed to infected houses; they refused to carry the white
    rods enjoined by law upon the convalescent; they went about among their
    fellows while they were still dangerous; and they would not keep the
    streets clean. The period of seclusion was fixed at four weeks; women
    were appointed to carry necessaries to infected houses; every morning
    at six, and every evening at eight the streets were to be sluiced with
    buckets of water; there were to be no funeral assemblies; beggars and
    masterless men were to be turned out of the City. These precautions
    were excellent; the sanitary laws were in the right direction; but all
    was rendered ineffectual for want of an executive; the Plague might
    have been stamped out had these rules been enforced; but they were not,
    and so the disease continued until the Great Fire of 1666 purified the
    soil. New investigations rendered necessary by the outbreak of Plague
    in India and elsewhere will perhaps lead to an abandonment of the old
    theory that the Plague was caused simply by the unclean condition of
    the ground, saturated with the abominations of a thousand years and
    more. Until science, however, has spoken more definitely, I suppose
    that we shall continue to associate a visitation of this terrible
    scourge with unsanitary conditions. It is at least a useful and a
    wholesome belief.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have before me certain infallible remedies prescribed in the attack
    of 1625. Among them are blisters, clysters, cauteries, poultices,
    cuppings, strong purges<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
    and emetics. Drugs and strange compounds
    were also administered. Among the former, London treacle, Venice
    treacle, angelica root, dragon water, and carduus play a large part.
    The roots of certain wild flowers were also powdered and added to the
    infusion, showing that the medicine of the time depended largely on the
    science of the herbwoman. Who but she knew the properties of the roots
    and leaves of tormentil, sorrel, goat’s rue, gentian, bay berries,
    scabious, bur seeds, celandine? Who but a village herbalist could have
    discovered the healing powers of fresh cowdung strained with vinegar?
    I transcribe one of many prescriptions to induce a strong sweat and
    thereby to expel the Plague.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “Take the inward Bark of the Ash Tree one Pound, of Walnuts with
      the Green outward Shells, to the number of Fifty, cut these small:
      of Scabious, of Vervin, of each a Handful, of Saffron two Drams,
      pour upon these the strongest Vinegar you can get, four Pints, let
      them a little boil together upon a very soft fire, and then stand
      in a very close Pot, well stopt all Night upon the Embers, after
      distil them with a soft Fire, and receive the Water close kept.
      Give unto the Patient laid in Bed and well covered with Cloaths,
      two Ounces of this Water to drink, and let him be provoked to
      Sweat; and every eight hours (during the space of four and twenty
      Hours) give him the same quantity to Drink.
    </p>

    <p>
      Care must be taken in the use of these Sweating Cordials, that the
      Party infected, sweat two or three Hours, or rather much longer,
      if he have strength, and sleep not till the Sweat be over, and
      that he have been well wiped with warm Linnen and when he hath
      been dried let him wash his Mouth with Water and Vinegar Warm,
      and let his face and Hands be washed with the same. When these
      things are done, give him a good Draught of Broth made with Chicken
      or Mutton, with Rosemary, Thyme, Sorrel, succory and Marygolds;
      or else Water-Grewel, with Rosemary and Winter-Savory or Thyme,
      Panado seasoned with Verjuice, or juice of Wood-Sorrel: for their
      Drink, let it be small Beer warmed, with a Toast, or Water boiled
      with Carraway-Seed, Carduus-Seed, and a Crust of Bread, or such
      Posset-Drink as is mentioned before in the second Medicine; after
      some Nutriment, let them sleep or rest, often washing their Mouth
      with Water and Vinegar.”
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Or instead of the complicated nostrum, here are two. By the first, it
    is said, “Secretary Naunton removed the Plague from his Heart.” The
    second, it is asserted, was prepared by Sir Francis Bacon and approved
    by Queen Elizabeth.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “An Ale Posset-drink with Pimpernel seethed in it, till it taste
      strong of it, drunk often, removed the infection, tho’ it hath
      reached the very heart....
    </p>

    <p>
      Take a Pint of Malmsey burnt, with a spoonful of bruised Grains,
      <i xml:lang="la">i.e.</i>, Cardamom Seeds, of the best Treacle a spoonful, and give
      the Patient to drink of it two or three Spoonfuls pretty often,
      with a draught of Malmsey Wine after it, and so let him sweat; if
      it agrees with him, and it stays with him, he is out of Danger; if
      he vomits it up, repeat it again.”
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Let us leave the Plague for a moment and consider the general subject
    of medicine in the seventeenth century.
  </p>

  <p>
    When he was ill, the Londoner had as many nostrums and infallible
    medicines as his successor of the present day. We have our effervescent
    drinks, our pills, our ointments—so had our ancestor. First of all,
    the pharmacopœia included an immense quantity of herbs, specifics for
    this and the other; their names still preserve some of their supposed
    qualities—such as fever few, eye-bright, etc. Thus, walnut water was
    supposed to be good for sore eyes. The apothecary understood how to
    cover<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
    a pill with sugar so as to make it tasteless; and his pills
    were great boluses which we should now find it hard indeed to swallow.
    The physicians prescribed potions fearfully and wonderfully made,
    some containing thirty, forty, or even seventy ingredients. Such was
    “Mithidate” or “Mithridates,” as a common medicine was called.
  </p>

  <p>
    For fevers they prescribed a “cold water affusion,” with drinking
    of asses’ milk. When the Queen was ill in 1663 they shaved her head
    and applied pigeons to her feet. When a man fell down in a fit, they
    treated him vigorously. No half measures were allowed. They boxed and
    cuffed his ears, pulled his nose, threw a bucket of cold water into his
    face, and pinched and kneaded the nape of his neck. Powdered mummy for
    a long time was held to be a specific against I know not what diseases.
    It is said that the reason why it went out of use was that Jews took to
    embalming bodies and then sold them for genuine ancient mummies.
  </p>

  <p>
    If a dentist was wanted he was sought in the street; he was an
    itinerant tooth drawer, and he went his regular round, carrying with
    him his “dentist’s key” and decorated with strings of teeth, while he
    bawled his calling and offered his services.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ben Jonson ridicules the pretences and pretensions of the quacks of his
    time when he puts the following extravagance into the mouth of Bobadil:—
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “Sir, believe me, upon my relation for what I tell you, the
      world shall not reprove. I have been in the Indies, where this
      herb grows, where neither myself, nor a dozen gentlemen more of
      my knowledge, have received the taste of any other nutriment in
      the world, for the space of one and twenty weeks but the fume of
      this simple only; therefore, it cannot be, but ’tis most divine.
      Further, take it in the nature, in the true kind: so, it makes an
      antidote, that, had you taken the most deadly poisonous plant in
      all Italy, it should expel it, and clarify you, with as much ease
      as I speak. And for your green wound—your Balsamum and your St.
      John’s wort, are all mere gulleries and trash to it, especially
      your Trinidado: your Nicotian is good too. I could say what I know
      of the virtue of it, for the expulsion of rheums, raw humours,
      crudities, obstructions, with a thousand of this kind, but I
      profess myself no quacksalver. Only this much: by Hercules, I do
      hold it, and will affirm it before any prince in Europe, to be the
      most sovereign and precious weed that ever the earth tendered to
      the use of man.”
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Francis Bacon—the last of his generation to be considered a
    quack—prescribed a regimen which would make longevity a certainty.
  </p>

  <p>
    Every morning the patient was to inhale the fume of lignaloes,
    rosemary, and bay-leaves dried; “but once a week to add a little
    tobacco, without otherwise taking it, in a pipe.” For supper he was
    to drink of wine in which “gold had been quenched,” and to eat bread
    dipped in spiced wine. In the morning he was to anoint the body with
    oil of almonds and salt and saffron. Once a month he was to bathe
    the feet in water of marjoram, fennel, and sage.... That diet was
    pronounced best “which makes lean and then renews.” The great people
    were content with nothing less than extravagant remedies. Salt or
    chloride of gold was taken by noble ladies; dissolved pearls were
    supposed to have mystic virtues, and even coral was a fashionable
    medicine.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span></p>

  <p>
    Common folk had to submit to more desperate remedies. They were advised
    by Dr. Andrew Boorde to wipe their faces daily with a scarlet cloth,
    and wash them only once a week. Pills made of the skull of a man
    that had been hanged, a draught of spring water from the skull of a
    murdered man, the powder of antimony, the oil of scorpions, the blood
    of dragons, and the entrails of wild animals were all recommended
    for special diseases. Salves, conserves, cataplasms, ptisanes, and
    electuaries were made of all kinds of herbs, and freely used and
    believed in, though most of them must have been ridiculous. The
    “nonsense-confused compounds” which Burton ridiculed half a century
    later were in great demand, however, and the amount of general
    physic-taking was marvellous. Complexion-washes for ladies and fops,
    love-philtres for the melancholy, and anodynes for the aged, were
    commonly dispensed in every apothecary’s establishment.
  </p>

  <p>
    Tumours were supposed to be curable by stroking them with the hand
    of a dead man. Chips of a hangman’s tree were a great remedy for the
    ague, worn as amulets. To cure a child of rickets, it was passed head
    downwards through a young tree split open for the purpose, and then
    tied up. As the tree healed, the child recovered. The king’s evil, a
    scrofulous affection, was supposed to be cured by the royal touch, as
    we have already seen in considering the service for the occasion. There
    is a description of the process in Macbeth:—

    One learns from Ben Jonson that at St. Katherine’s by the Tower there

      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i3">“Those are all broken loose</div>

    The cunning man or woman was a kind of physician and in large practice.
    He undertook to cure all diseases under the sun by the “Ephemerides,”
    the marks on almanacks of lucky or unlucky days. Besides his medical
    learning he knew how to advise in the matter of winning at horse races;
    in card playing, how to win; he could search for things lost, he
    sold charms, he told girls about their future lovers, and he erected
    astrological figures. Often he was a physician by profession, like that
    unfortunate Dr. Lambe, done to death by the crowd in the City for being
    an astrologer or cunning man.
  </p>

  <p>
    The level of medical science in the seventeenth century may be judged
    by the prescriptions which follow:—
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“(1) For Dimness of sight.</p>

    <p>
      For dimness of the Eyes, eat 12 leaves of Rue in a morning with
      bread and butter and it will very much availe.”
    </p>

    <p>For the stopping of bleeding</p>

    <p>
      “Take red nettles, stamp them and straine them alone, then take the
      juice and rubb all over the forehead and temples, so lett it dry
      upon the face 7 or 8 hours, after you may wash it of, but if you
      bleede againe, renew it.”
    </p>

    <p>For the plague we have</p>

    <p>
      “The Medicine that the Lord Mayor of London had sent him from Q.
      Elisa: the ingredients are sage, rue, elder leaves, red bramble
      leaves, white wine and ginger. ‘So drink of it till evening and
      morning 9 dayes together: the first spoonfull will by God’s grace
      preserve safe for 24 dayes and after the ninth spoonfull for one
      whole yeare.’”
    </p>

    <p>Another “safe medicine” is as follows:—</p>

    <p>
      “Take a locke of your Owne hair, cutt it as small as may bee, and
      so take it in beere or wine.”
    </p>

    <p>The next is not so appetising. For a dull hearing</p>

    <p>
      “Take a grey snaile, prick him, and putt the water which comes from
      him into the eare and stop it with blackwool, it will cure.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “(2) To cure the biting or stinging of a Snake, as it hath often
      been tryed.
    </p>

    <p>
      ‘Take the leaves of a Burr-dock stamp and straine them and so
      drinke a good quantity, halfe a pint at the least, the simple juice
      itselfe is best.’
    </p>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span></p>

    <p>(3) A most pretious Water of Wallnutts.</p>

    <p>
      Cures many ailments. Among the rest: ‘One drop in the eyes healeth
      all infirmityes, it healeth palsyes, it causeth sleep in the night.
      If it be used moderately with wine, it preserveth life so long as
      nature will permitt.’
    </p>

    <p>(4) For Sciatica.</p>

    <p>
      The principal ingredient is the marrow of a horse (killed by
      chance, not dying of any disease) mixed with some rose water.
      ‘Chafe it in with a warme hand for a quarter of an houre, then putt
      on a Scarlett cloth, broad enough to cover the parte affected and
      go into a warme bed.’
    </p>

    <p>(5) Headache.</p>

    <p>
      The juice of Ground-ivy snuft up into the nose out of a spoone
      taketh away the greatest paine thereof. This medicine is worth gold.
    </p>

    <p>
      (6) For consumption is recommended an infusion in which the following
      ingredients take part:—
    </p>

    <p>
      “Malaga-sacke, liverwort, Dandelion-root scrapt and the pith tooke
      out, and a piece of Elecampane sliced.
    </p>

    <p>(7) Madness in a Dog or anything:—</p>

    <p>
      Pega, tega, sega, docemena, Mega. These words written and the paper
      rowl’d up and given to a Dog or anything that is mad, will cure
      him.”
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Floyer, for his part, placed the greatest reliance on the sovereign
    virtues of cold water, administered externally. He spared no pains
    to inculcate on sufferers from rheumatism, nervous disorders, and
    other maladies, the virtue of cold bathing, and maintained that the
    prevalence of consumption in this country dated only from the time when
    baptism by immersion had been discontinued.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have mentioned the “cunning man” who was also an astrologer. But
    there was the astrologer in higher practice. Everybody believed
    in astrology, from the King downwards. The astrologer followed a
    profession both lucrative and honourable. Sometimes, as in the case
    of Dr. Nenier of Linford, he was an enthusiast who prayed continually
    and was in confidential communication with the archangels, being by
    them enabled to heal many diseases, especially ague, and the falling
    sickness by means of consecrated rings.
  </p>

  <p>
    When the Civil War began there were astrologers on both sides
    who prophesied, each for the good of his own cause. Thus, on the
    Parliamentary side the astrologer prophesied disasters to the Cavaliers
    and victory to the Roundheads. These predictions became weapons of
    great weight because people believed them. Butler puts the case in his
    own way:—

    The most important of the tribe was William Lilly, already mentioned,
    who wrote on the Roundhead side, publishing his predictions in
    an almanack called <cite>Merlinus Anglicus</cite>. Towards the close of the
    Protectorate he had the good sense to see what was coming and to
    predict the Restoration. When this came he made his almanack loyal to
    the backbone. Astrology fell somewhat into disrepute after Charles’s
    return, or perhaps younger men got all the patronage, for Lilly
    abandoned astrology and took up with medicine.

  <p>
    The Royal Society had not yet been founded, and the only learned
    association was the Society of Antiquaries, formed by Archbishop Parker
    in 1572, meeting weekly at the College of Heralds and dissolved by
    James I. “from some jealousy,” remarks Hallam, about the year 1604.
    Consequently there were no influences at work to stem the popular
    superstitions, and individuals who profited by them were not likely
    to turn reformers. The trade in charms was, however, more than half
    sanctioned by the learned. In his <cite>Natural History</cite>, Bacon lays it down
    as credible that precious stones “may work by consent upon the spirits
    of men to comfort and exhilarate them. The best for that effect are
    the diamond, the emerald, the hyacinth Oriental, and the gold stone,
    which is the yellow topaz. As for their particular properties, there
    is no credit to be given to them. But it is manifest that light, above
    all things, excelleth in comforting the spirits of men: and it is very
    probable that light varied doth the same effect, with more novelty, and
    this is one of the causes why precious stones comfort.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Bracelets of coral are recommended to cool the body, because coral
    loseth colour through “distemper of heat,” and other varieties for
    similar purposes. The learned lawyer and philosopher was thus not many
    degrees higher than the plain and simple folk who imagined that every
    precious stone had some mystic virtue communicable to the wearer. The
    sapphire was believed to impart courage, the coral to preserve from
    enchantment, the topaz to cure madness, and the hyacinth to protect
    from lightning. As for the carbuncle, with its brilliant unborrowed
    light, it is referred to many times by Shakespeare, but perhaps in the
    happiest form in “Henry VIII.,” where the Princess Elizabeth is spoken
    of as

  </div>

  <p class="noindent">
    <span class="smcap">There</span> was very little difference between the London of Elizabeth and
    the London of Charles II. I briefly quote a contemporary. The following
    humorous description was written by Sir William Davenant two or three
    years before the Fire:—
  </p>

  <p>
    “Sure your ancestors contrived your narrow streets in the days of
    wheel-barrows, before those greater engines, carts, were invented. Is
    your climate so hot, that as you walk, you need umbrellas of tiles
    to intercept the sun? Or, are your shambles so empty, that you are
    afraid to take in fresh air, lest it should sharpen your stomachs?
    Oh, the goodly landslip of Old Fish Street, which, had it not had
    the ill luck to be crooked, was narrow enough to have been your
    founder’s perspective! And where the garrets, (perhaps not for want
    of architecture, but through abundance of amity) are so made, that
    opposite neighbours may shake hands without stirring from home. Is
    unanimity of inhabitants in wise cities better exprest than by their
    coherence and uniformity of building: where streets begin, continue and
    end, in a like stature and shape? But yours (as if they were raised in
    a general insurrection, where every man hath a several design) differ
    in all things that can make distinction. Here stands one that aims to
    be a Palace, and, next it, another that professes to be a hovel; here a
    giant, there a dwarf: here slender, there broad: and all most admirably
    different in faces as well as in their height and bulk. I was about
    to defie any Londoner, who dares pretend there is so much ingenious
    correspondence in this City, as that he can shew me one house like
    another: yet your houses seem to be reverend and formal, being compared
    to the fantastical looks of the modern: which have more ovals, niches,
    and angles, than are in your custards, and are inclosed with pasteboard
    walls, like those of malicious Turks, who, because themselves are not
    immortal, and cannot dwell for ever where they build, therefore wish
    not to be at charge to provide such lastingness as may entertain their
    children out of the rain:
    so slight and prettily gaudy, that if they
    could more, they would pass for pageants. It is your custom, where men
    vary often the mode of their habits, to term the nation fantastical:
    but where streets continually change fashion, you should make haste to
    chain up the city, for it is certainly mad.

    “You would think me a malicious traveller if I should still gaze on
    your misshapen streets, and take no more notice of the beauty of your
    river: therefore, I will pass the importunate noise of your watermen
    (who snatch at fares as if they were to catch prisoners, plying the
    gentry so uncivilly, as if they had never rowed any other passengers
    but bearwards) and now step into one of your peascod boats, whose
    tilts are not so sumptuous as the roofes of gundaloes, nor when you
    are within are you at the ease of a chaise-à-bras. The commodity and
    trade of your river belong to yourselves: but give a stranger leave to
    share in the pleasure of it, which will hardly be in the prospect of
    freedom of air, unless prospect, consisting of variety, be made up with
    here a palace, there a wood-yard: here a garden, there a brew-house:
    here dwells a lord, there a dyer, and between both, <i xml:lang="la">duomo commune</i>.
    If freedom of air be inferred in the liberty of the subject, where
    every private man hath authority, for his own profit, to smoak up a
    magistrate, then the air of your Thames is open enough, because it
    is equally free. I will forbear to visit your courtly neighbours at
    Wapping, not that it will make me giddy to shoot your Bridge, but that
    I am loth to disturb the civil silence of Billingsgate, which is so
    great, as if the mariners were always landing to storm the harbour:
    therefore, for brevity’s sake, I will put to shoar again, though I
    should be constrained, even without my galoshoes, to land at Puddle
    Dock.
  </p>

  <p>
    “I am now returned to visit your houses, where the roofs are so
    low, that I presume your ancestors were very mannerly and stood
    bare to their wives: for I cannot discern how they could wear their
    high-crowned hats: yet, I will enter, and therein oblige you much,
    when you know my aversion to a certain weed that governs amongst your
    coarser acquaintance as much as lavender amongst your coarser linen; to
    which, in my apprehension, your sea-coal smoke seems a very Portugal
    perfume. I should here hasten to a period, for fear of suffocation, if
    I thought you so ungracious as to use it in public assemblies: and yet,
    I see it grows so much in fashion, that methinks your children begin to
    play with broken pipes instead of corals, to make way for their teeth.
    You will find my visit short; I cannot stay to eat with you, because
    your bread is too heavy, and you disdain the light substance of herbs.
    Your drink is too thick, and yet you are seldom over-curious in washing
    your glasses. Nor will I lodge with you, because your beds seem no
    bigger than coffins: and your curtains so short, as they will hardly
    serve to inclose your carriers in summer, and may be held, if taffata,
    to have lined your grand-sires’ skirts.
  </p>

  <p>
    “I have now left your houses, and am passing that of your streets,
    but not in a coach, for they are uneasily hung, and so narrow, that
    I took them for sedans upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
    wheels: nor is it safe for a stranger
    to use them till the quarrel be decided whether six of your nobles,
    sitting together, shall stop and give way to as many barrels of beer.
    Your city is the only metropolis in Europe where there is wonderful
    dignity belonging to carts. I would now make a safe retreat, but that
    methinks I am stopt by one of our heroic games, called foot-ball:
    which I conceive (under your favour) not very conveniently civil in
    the streets, especially in such irregular and narrow roads as Crooked
    Lane. Yet it argues your courage much like your military pastime of
    throwing at cocks: but your metal would be much magnified (since you
    have long allowed those two valiant exercises in the streets) to draw
    your archers from Finsbury, and during high market let them shoot at
    butts in Cheapside. I have now no more to say but what refers to a
    few private notes, which I shall give you in a whisper when we meet
    in Moorfields, from whence (because the place was meant for public
    pleasure, and to shew the munificence of your City) I shall desire you
    to banish the laundresses and bleachers, whose acres of old linen make
    a shew like the fields of Carthagena when the five months’ shifts of
    the whole fleet are washt and spread.”
  </p>

  <p>
    To this satirical note let us add a glance at the suburbs with the
    help of Hollar’s map of 1665. In this map Lambeth is evidently a
    small village lying south of the church and Palace, with at least
    one street running along the road on the east leading across to St.
    George’s Fields. On the north there are no houses; the Palace Gardens
    stretch out behind the Embankment, covered with trees; then comes
    the Lambeth Marsh, a broad field bare of trees; there is a broad
    mile where the river bends, and here, buried among the trees, houses
    begin, and continue along Bankside; on the east of Lambeth Marsh is
    St. George’s Fields, with houses on the north side, and St. George’s
    Church. According to Hollar, South London at this time must have been
    a charming and rural place divided into gardens and set with trees.
    Unfortunately his picture becomes unintelligible when we find St. Mary
    Overies on the other side of the river.

    </h3>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">
    <span class="smcap">If</span>, as some hold, the cause of the long-continued Plague, which
    lasted, with intervals of rest, from the middle of the sixteenth
    century to 1665, was nothing but the accumulated filth of London, so
    that the ground on which it stood was saturated many feet in depth
    with poisonous filtrations, the Fire of 1666 must be regarded in the
    light of a surgical operation absolutely essential if life was to be
    preserved, and as an operation highly successful in its results. For it
    burned, more or less, every house and every building over an area of
    436 acres out of those which made up London within the walls.
  </p>

  <p>
    It began in the dead of night—Sunday morning, 3 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>,
    September 2, 1666—at the shop of one Farryner, a baker, in Pudding
    Lane, one of those narrow lanes which run to north and south of Thames
    Street. All the houses in that lane were of wood, pitched throughout,
    and as the stories jutted out, the houses almost met at the top. The
    house itself was full of brush and faggot wood, so that the Fire
    quickly grew to a head, and then began to spread out in all directions
    at once, but especially to the west and north. Close to the house
    was an inn called the “Star,” the courtyard of which was full of hay
    and straw. In a very short time Pudding Lane itself was completely
    destroyed; it would seem as if the people were distracted and attempted
    little or nothing except their own escape. When day broke the fire
    had caught Thames Street, which was full of warehouses containing
    everything combustible, as butter, cheese, brandy, wine, oil, sugar,
    hemp, flax, tar, pitch, rosin, brimstone, cordage, hops, wood, and
    coal. The only means of combating a fire fed by such materials was
    to blow up the houses, and this the people vehemently opposed at
    first. As for the supply of water, there was none at all adequate to
    the situation, and the water machines of London Bridge were quickly
    destroyed with the houses on the Bridge. In order to escape and to
    carry away their property, every available vehicle, cart, waggon,
    carriage, or boat, was in requisition. Forty pounds was offered and
    given by many householders for the safe removal of their property,
    while in some cases—those of the wealthy—£400 was paid simply to get
    the plate and jewels and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
    other valuables carried out of the reach of
    the Fire. The things were taken out into the open fields, where they
    were laid on the grass, and so left in charge of the owners; open and
    unconcealed robberies took place, as was to be expected. Some of the
    people placed their things for safety in the churches, fondly thinking
    that the fire would spare them; the booksellers of Little Britain and
    Paternoster Row deposited the whole of their books in the crypt of St.
    Paul’s; alas! they lost them all. Those who had friends in the villages
    near London carried away their money and their valuables and deposited
    them in the houses of these friends. Pepys buried his treasure in the
    garden of Sir W. Ryder at Bethnal Green. He afterwards describes how he
    dug it up again and how he lost some of the money by the decay of the
    bags.

  <p>
    A strong easterly wind carried the flames along from roof to roof, and
    from house to house, and from street to street. The fire raged almost
    unchecked. By Monday morning it had covered the area between Pudding
    Lane and Gracechurch Street and Lombard Street, and to St. Swithin’s in
    Candlewick Street, along the river as far as the Three Cranes in the
    Vintry. By Tuesday night it had destroyed everything as far west as
    St. Dunstan’s in Fleet Street. By this time the men arrived from the
    dockyards, and by blowing up houses the fire was stopped at a great
    many points at once; the Duke of York superintended the work, and
    gained all hearts by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
    his powerful labours in handing the buckets and
    giving orders. On Wednesday the fire broke out again in the Temple,
    but was reduced without difficulty. The damage done by this terrible
    calamity was computed, to put it into figures, as follows:—of houses
    destroyed, 13,200; their value, £3,900,000; of streets, 400; of parish
    churches, 87; their value, £261,600; of consecrated chapels, 6; their
    value, £12,000; of wares, goods, etc., £3,800,000; of public edifices
    burned, £939,000; St. Paul’s rebuilt at a cost of £2,000,000. The whole
    loss, with other and smaller items, was reckoned at £10,730,500. The
    public buildings destroyed included St. Paul’s Cathedral, eighty-seven
    parish churches, six consecrated chapels, the Royal Exchange, the
    Custom House, Sion College, the Grey Friars Church, St. Thomas of
    Acon, the Justice House, the four prisons, fifty companies’ halls,
    and four gates. By this time many of the former nobles’ town houses
    and the great merchants’ palaces had been taken down and turned into
    private houses, warehouses, and shops; as, for instance, the Erber,
    Cold Harbour, la Riole, the King’s Wardrobe, and others. The mediæval
    buildings with the exception of the churches had all gone, but there
    was still left a great quantity of remains, walls, vaults, arches, and
    other parts of ancient buildings, the loss of which to the antiquary
    and the historian was irreparable.
  </p>

  <p>
    This appalling calamity is without parallel in history except, perhaps,
    the earthquake of Lisbon. Once before there had been a fire which swept
    London from east to west, but London was then poor; there were few
    merchants, and the warehouses were small and only half-filled. In 1665
    the warehouses were vast and filled with valuable merchandise. There
    still stands south of Thames Street a warehouse<a id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> built immediately
    after the Fire, evidently in imitation of its predecessors. It consists
    of seven or eight stories, all low; there are still small gables,
    a reminiscence of the old gables; looking upon this warehouse and
    remembering that there was a long row of these facing the river with
    lanes and river stairs between, we can understand the loss to the
    merchants caused by the conflagration. Considering also the rows of
    shops along Cheapside, Eastcheap, Ludgate Hill, and Cornhill, we can
    understand the ruin that fell upon the retail dealers in that awful
    week. All they had in the world was gone save the right of rebuilding
    on the former site. The master craftsmen lost their tools and their
    workshops; the bookseller lost his books; the journeyman lost his
    employment as well as his sticks. I quote here certain words of my own
    in another book:—
  </p>

  <p>
    “The fire is out at last; the rain has quenched the last sparks; the
    embers have ceased to smoke; those walls which have not fallen totter
    and hang trembling, ready to fall. I see men standing about singly;
    the tears run down their cheeks; two hundred years ago, if we had
    anything to cry about, we were not ashamed to cry without restraint;
    they are dressed in broad-cloth, the ruffles are of lace, they look
    like reputable citizens. Listen—one draws near another. ‘Neighbour,’
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
    he says, ‘a fortnight ago, before this stroke, whether of God or of
    Papist, I had a fair shop on this spot.’ ‘And I also, good friend,’
    said the other, ‘as you know.’ ‘My shop,’ continued the first, ‘was
    stocked with silks and satins, kid gloves, lace ruffles and neckties,
    shirts, and all that a gentleman or gentlewoman can ask for. The stock
    was worth a thousand pounds. I turned it over six or seven times a year
    at least. And my profit was four hundred pounds.’ ‘As for me,’ said the
    other, ‘I was in a smaller way, as you know. Yet such as it was, my
    fortune was all in it, and out of my takings, I could call two hundred
    pounds a year my own.’ ‘Now is it all gone,’ said the first. ‘All
    gone,’ the other repeated, fetching a sigh. ‘And now, neighbour, unless
    the Company help, I see nothing for it but we must starve.’ ‘Must
    starve,’ the other repeated. And so they separated, and went divers
    ways, and whether they starved or whether they received help, and rose
    from the ashes with new house and newly stocked shop, I know not.”

    It is generally believed that the Fire left nothing standing where
    it had passed. This was not the case. Many of the church towers were
    left in part. Only the other day in building offices in the City on
    the site of a church—St. Olave’s, Old Jewry—it was discovered that the
    lower part of the tower with the stone turret outside belonged to the
    old church. Many crypts escaped; the walls where they were
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span> of brick
    remained standing in part; in one case a whole court survived the Fire.
    This case is very curious. On the north-east of Apothecaries’ Hall,
    with an entrance from Castle Street, was, until a year or two ago, a
    court called Fleur de Lys Court. At the time of the Fire there stood
    close beside the court, on the east side, the church and churchyard
    of St. Anne’s, built after the Dissolution upon part of the old
    Blackfriars. Remember that the wind was easterly and strong during
    the Fire. When the roof of St. Anne’s caught fire, therefore, the
    flames were driven across this court and over it. It would appear that
    the roof had been injured and part of the upper stories, but not the
    lower part. The court looked strangely out of keeping with the other
    buildings. I took my friend Mr. Loftie to see it. He gave it as his
    opinion at once that the mullions of the windows were of earlier date
    than the Fire. I afterwards took Mr. J. J. Stevenson, the architect,
    who made one or two sketches and came to the same conclusion. A few
    weeks later I found that they were pulling the court down.
  </p>

  <p>
    The causes of the Fire and the conditions which made its existence
    possible are thus enumerated by Strype:—
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “First, They consider the time of the night when it first began,
      viz. between one and two of the clock after midnight, when all were
      in a dead sleep.
    </p>

    <p>
      Secondly, it was Saturday night when many of the most eminent
      citizens, merchants, and others were retired into the country and
      none but servants left to look to their City Houses.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thirdly, it was in the long vacation, being that particular time
      of the year when many wealthy citizens and tradesmen are wont to
      be in the country at Fairs, and getting in of Debts, and making up
      accounts with their Chapmen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fourthly, the closeness of the Building, and narrowness of the
      street in the places where it began, did much facilitate the
      progress of the Fire by hindering of the Engines to be brought to
      play upon the Houses on Fire.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fifthly, the matter of which the Houses, all thereabouts were, viz.
      Timber, and those very old.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sixthly, the dryness of the preceding season: there having been a
      great drought even to that very day and all the time that the fire
      continued, which has so dried the Timber, that it was never more
      pat to take Fire.
    </p>

    <p>
      Seventhly, the Nature of the Wares and Commodities, stowed and
      vended in those Parts, were the most combustible of any other sold
      in the whole City: as Oil, Pitch, Tar, Cordage, Hemp, Flax, Rosin,
      Wax, Butter, Cheese, Wine, Brandy, sugar, etc.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eighthly, an easterly wind, which is the driest of all others,
      had blown for several days together before, and at that time very
      strongly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ninthly, the unexpected failing of the water thereabouts at that
      time: for the engine at the North end of London Bridge, called the
      Thames Water Tower, was out of Order, and in a few hours was itself
      burnt down, so that the water pipes which conveyed the water from
      thence through the streets were soon empty.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lastly, an unusual negligence at first, and a confidence of easily
      quenching it, and of its stopping at several probable places
      afterwards, turning at length into a confusion, consternation, and
      despair: people choosing rather by flight to save their goods, than
      by a vigorous opposition to save their own houses and the whole
      City.”
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    This dry reasoning would not satisfy the people. They began to
    whisper among each other that this was the work of an incendiary and
    a stranger; a Dutchman,
    or, more likely, a Roman Catholic. Divers
    strangers, Dutch and French, were arrested on suspicion of firing the
    City, but as there was no evidence they were released. What gave some
    colour to the suspicion was that, in April of that year, certain old
    officers and soldiers in Cromwell’s army, eight in number, were tried
    for conspiracy and treason, their design having been to surprise the
    Tower, to kill the Lieutenant, and then to have declared for an equal
    division of lands. After taking the Tower their purpose was to set fire
    to the City. They were all found guilty, condemned, and executed. After
    the fire there was brought to the Lord Chief Justice a boy of ten, who
    declared that his father and uncle, Dutchmen both, were the persons
    who set fire to the house in Pudding Lane with fire-balls. This little
    villain appears to have been sent off as an impostor.

  <p>
    Then, however, followed Robert Hubert’s confession, which was far more
    important. The man Hubert confessed or declared that about four months
    before the Fire he left his native town of Rouen with one Piedloe,
    and went with him to Sweden, where he stayed four months; that they
    came together in a Swedish ship to London, staying on board till the
    night when the fire began; that Piedloe then took him to Pudding Lane
    and gave him a fire-ball, which he lighted and put through a window
    by means of a long pole, waiting till the house was well alight. One
    Graves, a French merchant, resident in London, said that he knew both
    Hubert and Piedloe; that the former was a mischievous person, capable
    of any wickedness, while the latter was a debauched fellow, also apt to
    any wickedness. Next, in order to try the man’s story, they took him to
    Pudding Lane and bade him point out Farryner’s house—or the site of it.
    This he did very readily. Then they questioned Farryner, who declared
    that no fire could possibly have broken out in his house by accident.
    On the other hand, the Swedish captain swore that Hubert did not land
    until after the Fire, and his confession was full of contradictions;
    also he declared himself a Protestant, yet died a Catholic; in the
    opinion of many he was a man of disordered mind; moreover, why should
    Piedloe take him as companion when he might just as well have done the
    job himself? And how should a complete stranger taken into the dark
    streets of London for the first time in the dead of night be able to
    recognise again the street or the house?
  </p>

  <p>
    In any case Hubert was hanged; and as he died a Catholic, it was of
    course abundantly clear that the whole thing was a Catholic conspiracy,
    a fact which was accordingly inscribed on the new monument when it was
    erected, so that
  </p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">“London’s column pointing to the skies,</div>
        <div class="i1">Like a tall bully lifts its head and lies.”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">
    The inscription was removed on the accession of James the Second, but
    put up again on the arrival of William the Third. It remained on the
    monument till the year 1830, when it was taken down by order of the
    Common Council.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span></p>

  <p>
    It is generally stated that the houseless people took refuge in
    Moorfields. This is only partly true. There were 13,200 houses
    destroyed and 200,000 people turned out into the streets. One remarks
    that if these figures are correct the crowding in the City must have
    been very great. For these figures give fifteen persons to every
    house, great and small, one with another. They did not all lie out on
    Moorfields simply because there was no room for them. Upper and lower
    Moorfields covered an area of about 840,000 square feet, or a square of
    900 feet, very nearly. If we allow 15 feet × 20 feet for each hut to
    accommodate five people, we can find room for 2800 such houses without
    counting the lanes between them; so that Moorfields would contain
    about 14,000 people only. Evelyn says that the people were dispersed
    about St. George’s Fields, Moorfields, and as far as Highgate. “I then
    went towards Islington and Highgate, where one might have seen 200,000
    people of all ranks and degrees dispersed and lying along by their
    heaps of what they could save from the Fire.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “Pitiful huts,” Maitland says, “were erected for their accommodation,
    and for their immediate needs the King sent a great quantity of bread
    from the Navy Stores to be distributed, and neighbouring Justices of
    the Peace were enjoined to send in all manner of victuals.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was reputed that the loss of life was only six, but I venture to
    think that this loss must be greatly understated. When one considers
    the rapid spread of the fire, the way in which the people lingered
    to the last to save a little more, and when one remembers how Evelyn
    noticed on his first visit to the ruins the “stench from some poor
    creatures’ bodies,” we cannot but feel persuaded that the losses were
    more than six.
  </p>

  <p>
    On Moorfields temporary chapels also were built. But when the fire
    ceased, and before the embers were cooled, the people began to
    creep back and the rebuilding of the City began. As there was still
    remaining that part of the City east of Billingsgate with the river
    and the shipping, business went on, though with broken wings. For
    the Royal Exchange they used Gresham College; the same place became
    their Guildhall; the Excise Office was removed to Southampton Street,
    near Bedford House; the General Post Office was taken to Brydges
    Street, Covent Garden; the Custom House to Mark Lane; Doctors’ Commons
    to Exeter House, Strand. For temporary churches the authorities
    appropriated the meeting-houses which had not been destroyed. They
    began to rebuild their City. Within four years, ten thousand houses,
    twenty churches, and a great many companies’ halls had been put up
    again. It took thirty years to complete the building of the fifty-one
    churches which were put up in place of the eighty-seven destroyed.
  </p>

  <p>
    One effect of the Fire was to drive out of the City many of the
    shopkeepers. Thus Maitland says that before the Fire, Paternoster
    Row was chiefly occupied by mercers, silkmen, lacemen; “and these
    shops were so much resorted unto by the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span> nobility and gentry in their
    carriages that ofttimes the street was so stopped up, that there was
    no room for foot-passengers.” After the Fire, however, the tradesmen
    settled themselves in other parts; one supposes that they opened
    temporary shops, and, finding them convenient, they stayed where they
    were. They went to Henrietta Street, Bedford Street, and King Street,
    Covent Garden. Ludgate Hill, however, remained for a long time the
    principal street for the best shops of mercers and lacemen.
  </p>

  <p>
    Were so great and overwhelming a calamity to befall a City in our
    times, we should have abundant materials for estimating not only the
    total value of the destruction, but also its effect upon individuals.
    We learn next to nothing of the Fire as it affected classes, such as
    merchants, shopkeepers, or craftsmen. The Plague ruined its thousands
    by slaying the breadwinner; the Fire ruined its tens of thousands
    by destroying everything that the breadwinner possessed, warehouse,
    goods, and all. Credit remained, one supposes; by the aid of credit
    many recovered. Yet, one asks, what amount of credit could possibly
    replace the trader’s stock? What amount of credit could once more
    fill the great warehouse crammed to the very roof with commodities?
    Those who were debtors found their debts wiped off; one supposes that
    all prisoners for debt were enlarged; those who were creditors could
    not collect their amounts; rents could neither be asked nor paid; the
    money-lender and the borrower were destroyed together; almshouses
    were burnt down—what became of the poor old men and women? The City
    charities were suspended—what became of the poor? In such a universal
    dislocation, revolution, and cessation of everything, the poor man lost
    all that he had to lose, and the rich were sent empty away. Would that
    some limner of the time had portrayed for us a faithful picture of the
    first meeting of the Common Council after the Fire! Dryden speaks of
    the Fire:—
  </p>

  <div class="center-container">

        <div class="i0">“Those who have homes, when home they do repair</div>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    One thing is certain: for the working man there was no lack of
    employment; thousands were wanted to clear away the rubbish, to get
    the streets in order, to take down shaky walls, to make bricks, to dig
    out foundations, to do carpenter’s work and all those things required
    for the creation of a new London. And as for the artificers, they were
    wanted to restore the stocks of the traders as quickly as
    might be.
    Labour was never in such request before in all the history of London.

  <p>
    Twenty-five years later they were congratulating themselves on the
    changed and improved condition of the City. The writer of <cite>Anglia
    Metropolis</cite>, or <cite>the Present State of London</cite>,<a id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> says:—
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “As if the Fire had only purged the City, the buildings are
      infinitely more beautiful, more commodious, more solid (the three
      main virtues of all edifices) than before. They have made their
      streets much more large and straight, paved on each side with
      smooth free stone, and guarded the same with many massy posts for
      the benefit of foot passengers: and whereas before they dwelt in
      low dark wooden houses, they now live in lofty, lightsome, uniform,
      and very stately brick buildings.”
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Of the wooden houses commonly found in London before the Fire you
    will find one or two specimens still left—fifty years ago there were
    many. One such is in the Churchyard of St. Giles, Cripplegate. As
    to the total destruction of the houses I am in some doubt; I have
    already mentioned one court called the Fleur de Lys, Blackfriars,
    which escaped the Fire. The same fact that probably saved this Court
    may have saved other places. Strype, for instance, mentions a house
    in Aldersgate Street which survived the Fire. There were, again, many
    houses partially destroyed, some accident arresting the Fire, and
    there were many walls which could be used again. These considerations
    are confirmed by an examination of Hollar’s minute picture of London
    immediately after the Fire. In this picture all the churches are
    presented as standing with their towers; they are roofless and their
    windows are destroyed, but they are standing. It would be interesting
    to learn how much of these old walls and towers were used in the new
    buildings. Half the houses on London Bridge are gone, and the Bridge is
    evidently cleared of rubbish. Part of the front of Fishmongers’ Hall
    is still standing; All Hallows the Less, which appears to have been
    quite a small church, has no tower, but its walls are standing. Between
    that church and the river is a space covered with ruins, in the midst
    of which stands a pillar. The Water Gate remains at Cold Harbour; part
    of the front and the quay of the Steelyard, and a small part of the
    roof at the east end of St. Paul’s still remain, melancholy to look
    upon; the square port of Queenhithe is surrounded by fallen houses; the
    steeple of the Royal Exchange stands over the ruins; the river front of
    Baynard’s Castle still stands, but the eastern side is in ruins; the
    place is evidently gutted. In all directions there are walls, gables,
    whole houses standing among heaps and mounds of rubbish.
  </p>

  <p>
    Two circumstances must be reckoned fortunate: the Fire, while it burned
    down the churches and reduced the monuments to dust, also penetrated
    below the surface and transformed the dreadful mass of putrefaction
    caused by the Plague a year before into harmless dust. It also choked
    most of the numerous wells, whose bright and
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>sparkling waters charged
    with malarious filtrations the people had been accustomed to regard as
    sweet and healthy.
  </p>

  <p>
    The King issued a Proclamation on the rebuilding of the City. No houses
    of wood were to be put up; cellars, if possible, were to be strongly
    arched; the principal streets were to be made broader and no narrow
    lanes to remain; the river was to have a fair quay or wharf running
    all along, with no houses except at a certain distance; trades carried
    on by means of fire and causing smoke to be placed in certain quarters
    where they would be neither dangerous nor noisome; a survey of the
    whole area covered by the Fire was to be made. There were also Acts
    passed by the Court of Common Council for the enlargement and the
    pitching and levelling of the streets. These Acts will be found in
    <a href="#APPENDIX_V">Appendix V</a>.

      SIR CHRISTOPHER WREN (1632–1723)

  <p>
    Three plans were sent in to the Common Council for the laying out
    of the City in a more convenient manner; they were drawn up by
    Christopher Wren, who was appointed architect and surveyor-general,
    Sir John Evelyn, and Dr. Newcourt. The scheme of Wren was considered
    very carefully. It proved impossible, however, on account of the
    unwillingness of the people to give up their right of building on their
    old foundations. The scheme of Evelyn provided an embankment along the
    river,
    broad streets, piazzas round the churches, in which were to be
    shops; a Mansion House; a footway on London Bridge instead of houses;
    the churchyard of the whole City was to be a strip of ground under
    the old wall; opposite to the churchyard was to be a street set apart
    for inns and stations for carriers. It was, in short, a scheme quite
    impossible, yet remarkable for anticipating so much of what has since
    been carried out.

  </div>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span></p>
  <p>
    Meantime the rebuilding went on rapidly; in a few cases a street was
    widened; but the narrow lanes running north and south of Thames Street
    show that little regard was paid to the regulations. No wooden houses
    were built, and the old plan of high gables and projecting windows
    was exchanged for a flat façade and square coping. The churches were
    rebuilt, for the most part slowly. Some were not rebuilt at all.
    The last was finished thirty years after the Fire. Of the general
    character of Wren’s churches this is not the place for an estimate.
    It is sufficient here to explain that Wren was guided first by the
    sum of money at his disposal, and next by the extent of ground; that
    many of the old churches were quite small buildings standing in small
    churchyards; but he extended the foundations and increased the area of
    the church; that he built in every case a preaching-house and not a
    mass-house, so that nearly all the churches are oblong halls instead
    of cruciform buildings; that he studied the interior instead of the
    exterior, and that some of his finest churches inside present no
    feature of interest on the outside.
  </p>

  <p>
    The builders, all over the City, used as much as possible of the
    old foundations. Thus the Heralds’ College preserves the court
    of Derby House; Wardrobe Square is the inner court of the King’s
    Wardrobe Palace; while the narrow streets on either side of Cheapside
    preserve exactly the old lines of the streets burned down. It would
    be interesting to ascertain, if possible, where Wren’s churches were
    built upon the older foundations; the north wall of the Holy Trinity
    Minories, for instance, belongs to the ancient convent there; the
    vestry of Allhallows in the Wall is on a bastion of the wall.
  </p>

  <p>
    They altered the levels of many streets. Thames Street, “to prevent
    inundations,” which shows that, in parts at least, it was lower than
    the old embankment, was raised three feet, and the streets leading
    out of it raised in a proper proportion; many streets were ordered
    to be widened, but it does not appear that the order was in every
    case carried into effect; several new streets were constructed; a
    duty on coals, one shilling at first, and afterwards two shillings on
    every ton, was granted to the City for the express expenses of the
    rebuilding; a Court of Judicature was established for the purpose of
    deciding quickly all disputes as to rents, boundaries, debts, etc.,
    that might arise; the Court sat in the Hall of Clifford’s Inn; rules
    were laid down concerning the materials, thickness of party walls,
    etc., rules so minute that it is perfectly certain that they could
    not be carried out; they divided the City into four quarters; they
    ordered each quarter to provide 800 buckets with brass hand
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span> squirts
    and ladders of various lengths; they appointed a bellman for every
    ward, whose duty was to walk up and down the streets all night long
    from Michaelmas to the Annunciation of St. Mary; that on the alarm
    of fire every householder was to hang up a lantern over his door and
    provide an armed man: that every householder should keep at his door a
    vessel filled with water; with a great many more regulations which may
    be omitted, the whole showing the terrible scare into which they had
    all fallen. Forty years after the Fire, Dr. Woodward of Gresham College
    thus wrote to Wren (<cite>Strype</cite>, vol. i. p. 292) in a private letter that
  </p>

  <p>
    “The Fire of London, however disastrous it might be to the then
    inhabitants, had proved infinitely beneficial to their Posterity, and
    to the increase and vast improvement as well of the riches and opulency
    as of the buildings. And how by the means of the common sewers, and
    other like contrivances, such provision was made for sweetness, for
    cleanness, and for salubrity, that it is not only the finest and
    pleasantest, but the most healthy City in the world. Insomuch that for
    the Plague, and other infectious distempers, with which it was formerly
    so frequently annoyed, and by which so great numbers of the inhabitants
    were taken off, but the very year before the Fire, viz. Anno. 1665, an
    experience of above forty years since hath shewn it so wholly freed
    from, that he thought it probable it was no longer obnoxious to, or
    ever again likely to be infested by those so fatal and malicious
    maladies.”
  </p>

  <p>
    In May 1679 the people were thrown into a panic by the discovery of
    a so-called plot to burn down the City again. The house of one Bird
    in Fetter Lane having been burned, his servant, Elizabeth Oxley, was
    suspected of wilfully causing the fire; she was arrested and examined.
    What follows is a very remarkable story. The woman swore that she
    had actually caused the fire, and that she had been persuaded to do
    so by a certain Stubbs, a Papist, who promised her £5 if she would
    comply. Stubbs, being arrested, declared that the woman’s evidence was
    perfectly true, and that Father Gifford, his confessor, incited him
    to procure the Fire, saying that it would be a godly act to burn all
    heretics out of their homes. The Irishmen were also implicated; the
    Papists, it was said, were going to rise in insurrection in London and
    an army was to be landed from France. Five Jesuits were executed for
    this business, and so great was the popular alarm, that all Catholics
    were banished from the City and ten miles round.

    “Here”—Evelyn is the first of the four—“we saw the Thames covered with
    floating goods, all the barges and boates laden with what some had time
    and courage to save, as on the other, the carts carrying out to the
    fields, which for many miles were strewed with movables of all sorts,
    and tents erecting to shelter both people and what goods they could
    get away. Oh the miserable and calamitous spectacle! Such as happly
    the world had not seene the like since the foundation of it, nor be
    outdone till the universal conflagration of it. All the skie was of
    a fiery aspect, like the top of a burning oven, and the light seene
    above 40 miles round for many nights. God grant mine eyes may never
    behold the like, who now saw above 10,000 houses all in one flame: the
    noise and cracking and thunder of the impetuous flames, the shrieking
    of women and children, the hurry of people, the fall of Towers, Houses
    and Churches, was like a hideous storm, and the aire all about so hot
    and inflamed, that at the last one was not able to approach it, so that
    they were forced to stand still and let the flames burn on, which they
    did for neere two miles in length and one in bredth. The clowds also
    of smoke were dismall and reached upon computation neere 56 mile in
    length. Thus I left it this afternoone burning, a resemblance of Sodom,
    or the last day. It forcibly called to my mind that passage <i xml:lang="la">non enim
    hic habemus stabilem civitatem</i>: the ruines resembling the picture of
    Troy. London was, but is no more.”
  </p>

  <p>
    The next day he went to see the Fire again. All Fleet Street and the
    parts around it were in flames, the lead running down the streets in a
    stream, the stones of St. Paul’s “flying like granados.” The people,
    to the number of 200,000, had taken refuge in St. George’s Fields and
    Moorfields as far as Islington and Highgate; there Evelyn visited
    them; they were lying beside their heaps of salvage,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span> of all ranks and
    degrees, deploring their loss, and though ready to perish for hunger
    and destitution, yet not asking one penny for relief. It was not money
    they wanted, it was food and shelter. Can one conceive a picture more
    sorrowful than that of 200,000 people thus wholly ruined? Evelyn went
    home, and at once set to work on a plan for the reconstruction of the
    City.

  <p>Pepys has preserved fuller details:—</p>

  <p>
    “So I down to the water-side, and there got a boat and through bridge,
    and there saw a lamentable fire. Poor Michell’s house, as far as the
    Old Swan, already burned that way, and the fire running further, that
    in a very little time it got as far as the Steelyard while I was
    there. Everybody endeavouring to remove their goods, and flinging into
    the river or bringing them into lighters that lay off: poor people
    staying in their houses as long as till the very fire touched them,
    and then running into boats, or clambering from one pair of stairs by
    the water-side to another. And among other things, the poor pigeons,
    I perceive, were loth to leave their houses, but hovered about the
    windows and balconys till some of them burned their wings and fell
    down. Having staid, and in an hour’s time seen the fire rage every
    way, and nobody, to my sight, endeavouring to quench it, but only to
    remove<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
    their goods, and leave all to the fire, and having seen it get
    as far as the Steelyard, and the wind mighty high and driving it into
    the City, and everything after so long a drought, proving combustible,
    even the very stones of churches, and among other things the poor
    steeple by which pretty Mrs. —— lives, and whereof my old schoolfellow
    Elborough is parson, taken fire in the very top and there burned till
    it fell down: I to White Hall (with a gentleman with me who desired
    to go off from the Tower to see the Fire, in my boat), and to White
    Hall, and there up to the King’s closett in the Chappell, where people
    come about me, and I did give them an account dismayed them all, and
    the word was carried in to the King. So I was called for, and did tell
    the King and Duke of York what I saw, and that unless His Majesty
    did command houses to be pulled down, nothing could stop the fire.”...
    “Walked along Watling Street, as well as I could, every creature
    coming away loaden with goods to save, and here and there sicke people
    carried away in beds. Extraordinary good goods carried in carts and on
    backs. At last met ye Lord Mayor in Canning Street, like a man spent,
    with a handkercher about his neck. To the King’s message he cried like
    a fainting woman, ‘Lord! what can I do? I am spent; people will not
    obey me. I have been pulling down houses: but the fire overtakes us
    faster than we can do it.’ That he needed no more soldiers: and that,
    for himself, he must go and refresh himself, having been up all night.
    So he left me, and I him, and walked home, seeing people all almost
    distracted, and no manner of means used to quench the fire. The houses,
    too, so very thick thereabouts, and full of matter for burning, as
    pitch and tarr, in Thames Street: and warehouses of oyle, and wines,
    and brandy and other things.... And to see the churches all filling
    with goods by people who themselves should have been quietly there
    at this time.... Soon as dined, I and Moone away, and walked through
    the City, the streets full of nothing but people and horses and carts
    loaden with goods, ready to run over one another, and removing goods
    from one burned house to another. They now removing out of Canning
    Street (which received goods in the morning) into Lombard Street
    and further: and among others I now saw my little goldsmith Stokes,
    receiving some friend’s goods, whose house itself was burned the day
    after. We parted at Paul’s: he home, and I to Paul’s Wharf, where I
    had appointed a boat to attend me, and took in Mr. Carcasse and his
    brother, whom I met in the streets, and carried them below and above
    bridge to and again to see the fire, which was now got further, both
    below and above, and no likelihood of stopping it. Met with the King
    and Duke of York in their barge, and with them to Queenhithe, and there
    called Sir Richard Browne to them. Their order was only to pull down
    houses apace, and so below bridge at the water side: but little was
    or could be done, the fire coming upon them so fast. Good hopes there
    was of stopping it at the Three Cranes above, and at Buttolph’s Wharf
    below bridge, if care be used: but the wind carries it into the City,
    so as we know not by the water-side what
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
    it do there. River full of
    lighters, and boats taking in goods, and good goods swimming in the
    water, and only I observed that hardly one lighter or boat in three
    that had the goods of a house in, but there was a pair of Virginals in
    it.... So near the fire as we could for smoke: and all over the Thames,
    with one’s face in the wind, you were almost burned with a shower of
    fire-drops. This is very true: so as houses were burned by these drops
    and flakes of fire, three or four, nay, five or six houses, one from
    another. When we could endure no more upon the water, we to a little
    ale-house on the Bank-side over against the Three Cranes, and there
    staied till it was dark almost, and saw the fire grow: and as it grew
    darker, appeared more and more, and in corners and upon steeples, and
    between churches and houses, as far as we could see up the hill of
    the City, in a most horrid malicious bloody flame, not like the fine
    flame of an ordinary fire. Barbara and her husband away before us. We
    staid till, it being darkish, we saw the fire as only one entire arch
    of fire from this to the other side the bridge, and in a bow up the
    hill for an arch of above a mile long: it made me weep to see it. The
    churches, houses, and all on fire, and flaming at once: and a horrid
    noise the flames made, and the cracking of houses at their ruine.... I
    up to the top of Barking steeple, and there saw the saddest sight of
    desolation that I ever saw: everywhere great fires, oyle-cellars, and
    brimstone, and other things burning.... Walked into the town and find
    Fenchurch Streete, Gracious Streete, and Lumbard Streete all in dust.
    The Exchange a sad sight, nothing standing there, of all the statues
    or pillars, but Sir Thomas Gresham’s picture in the corner. Walked
    into Moorfields (our feet ready to burn walking through the towne
    among the hot coles), and find that full of people, and poor wretches
    carrying their goods there, and everybody keeping his goods together by
    themselves (and a great blessing it is to them that it is fair weather
    for them to keep abroad night and day).... To Bishop’s gate, where no
    fire had yet been near, and there is now one broken out: which did give
    great grounds to people, and to me too, to think that there is some
    kind of plot in this (on which many by this time have been taken, and
    it hath been dangerous for any stranger to walk in the streets), but I
    went with the men, and we did put it out in a little time: so that it
    was well again. It was pretty to see how hard the women did work in the
    cannells sweeping of water: but then they would scold for drink, and be
    as drunk as devils. I saw good butts of sugar broke open in the street,
    and people go and take handsfull out, and put into beer, and drink it.
    And now all being pretty well, I took boat, and over to Southwarke, and
    took boat to the other side the bridge, and so to Westminster, thinking
    to shift myself, being all in dirt from top to bottom: but could not
    find there any place to buy a shirt or pair of gloves, Westminster
    Hall being full of people’s goods, those in Westminster having removed
    all their goods, and the Exchequer money put into vessels to carry to
    Nonsuch: but to the Swan and there was trimmed: and then to White Hall,
    but saw nobody, and so home. A sad sight to see how the River looks:
    no houses nor church near it, to the Temple where it stopped.”

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span></p>
  <p>
    Here is a letter addressed to Lord Conway a few days after the Great
    Fire:—
  </p>

  <p>
    “Alas, my lord, all London almost within the walls, and some part of
    it which was without the walls, lies now in ashes. A most lamentable
    devouring fire began upon Sunday morning last, at one of the clock,
    at a baker’s house in Pudding Lane beyond the bridge, immediately
    burned down all the new houses upon the bridge, and left the old ones
    standing, and so came on into Thames Street, and went backwards towards
    the Tower, meeting with nothing by the way but old paper buildings
    and the most combustible matter of tar, pitch, hemp, rosin, and flax,
    which was all laid up thereabouts: so that in six hours it became a
    large stream of fire, at least a mile long, and could not possibly be
    approached or quenched. And that which contributed to the devastation
    was the extreme dryness of the season, which laid all the springs so
    low, that no considerable quantity of water could be had, either in
    pipes or conduits: and above all, a most violent and tempestuous east
    wind, which had sometimes one point towards the north, then again a
    point towards the south, as if it have been sent on purpose to help the
    fire to execute upon the City the commission which it had from Heaven.
  </p>

  <p>
    From Thames Street it went up Fish Street Hill into Canning Street,
    Gracechurch Street, Lombard Street, Cornhill, Bartholomew Lane,
    Lothbury, Austin Friars, and Broad Street northwards, and likewise into
    Fenchurch Street and Lime Street, burning down all the churches, the
    Royal Exchange, and all the little lanes and alleys as it went. From
    thence westward it swept away Friday Street, Watling Street, Cheapside,
    Newgate market, and the Prison, Paternoster Row, St. Sepulchre’s,
    and so up to Smithfield Bars, and down to Holborn bridge. Also all
    St. Paul’s Churchyard, the roof of Paul’s Church, Ludgate Hill, part
    of Fleet Street, Blackfriars, Whitefriars, and all the Inner Temple,
    till it came to the Hall, a corner of which had taken fire, and was
    there most happily quenched, as likewise in Fleet St. over against
    St. Dunstan’s Church: else, for aught appears, it might have swept
    away Whitehall and all the City of Westminster too, which is now left
    standing, together with all the suburbs: viz. the Strand, Covent
    Garden, Queen Street, Lincoln’s Inn fields, Holborn as far as the
    Bridge, and all Hatton Garden, Clerkenwell, and St. John Street.
  </p>

  <p>
    Of the City itself, from the Tower unto Temple Bar, remains only all
    Smithfield and St. Bartholomew’s, being stopped there before it came
    to Sir Elias Harvey’s, wherefrom, together with Sir John Shaw’s and
    Gresham College and so forward, are preserved: all Bishopsgate Street,
    Leadenhall Street, Duke’s Place, and so to Aldgate.
  </p>

  <p>
    But ’tis fit your lordship should know that all that is left, both
    of City and suburbs, is acknowledged, under God, to be wholly due to
    the King and Duke of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
    York, who, when the citizens had abandoned all
    further care of the place, were intent chiefly upon the preservation
    of their goods, undertook the work themselves, and with incredible
    magnanimity rode up and down, giving orders for blowing up of houses
    with gunpowder, to make void spaces for the fire to die in, and
    standing still to see those orders executed, exposing their persons not
    only to the multitude, but to the very flames themselves, and the ruins
    of buildings ready to fall upon them, and sometimes labouring with
    their own hands to give example to others: for which the people do now
    pay them, as they ought to do, all possible reverence and admiration.
    The King proceeds daily to relieve all the poor people with infinite
    quantities of bread and cheese, and in this is truly God’s vicegerent,
    that he does not only save from fire but give life too.

  </div>

  <p>
    I believe there was never any such desolation by fire since the
    destruction of Jerusalem, nor will be till the last and general
    conflagration. Had your lordship been at Kensington you would have
    thought—for five days together, for so long the fire lasted—it had
    been Doomsday, and that the heavens themselves had been on fire; and
    the fearful cries and howlings of undone people did much increase the
    resemblance. My walks and gardens were almost covered with the ashes
    of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
    papers, linen, etc., and pieces of ceiling and plaister-work blown
    thither by the tempest.
  </p>

  <p>
    The loss is inestimable, and the consequence to all public and private
    affairs not presently imaginable, but in appearance very dreadful: yet
    I doubt not but the king and his people will be able to weather it out,
    though our enemies grow insolent upon it.
  </p>

  <p>
    The greatest part of the wealth is saved, the loss having chiefly
    fallen upon heavy goods, wine, tobacco, sugars, etc.; but all the money
    in specie, plate, jewels, etc., were sent into the Tower, where it now
    lies; and the Tower itself had been fired, but that it preserved itself
    by beating down the houses about it, playing continually with their
    cannon upon all that was fired, and so stopped the progress.
  </p>

  <p>
    So great was the general despair, that when the fire was in the Temple,
    houses in the Strand, adjoining to Somerset House, were blown up on
    purpose to save that house, and all men, both in City and suburbs,
    carried away their goods all day and night by carts, which were not to
    be had but at most inhumane prices. Your lordship’s servant in Queen
    Street made a shift to put some of your best chairs and fine goods into
    your rich coach, and sent for my horses to draw them to Kensington,
    where they now are.
  </p>

  <p>
    Without doubt there was nothing of plot or design in all this, though
    the people would fain think otherwise. Some lay it upon the French and
    Dutch, and are ready to knock them all on the head, wheresoever they
    meet them; others upon the fanatics, because it broke out so near the
    3rd of September, their so celebrated day of triumph; others upon the
    Papists, because some of them are now said to be in arms; but ’tis no
    otherwise than as part of those militias which are, or ought to be, in
    a posture everywhere.
  </p>

  <p>
    All the stories of making and casting of fire-balls are found to be
    mere fictions when they are traced home; for that which was said to
    be thrown upon Dorset House was a firebrand, seen by the Duke of York
    upon the Thames to be blown thither, and upon notice thereof given by
    his highness was for that time quenched. But there could be no plot
    without some time to form it in: and making so many parties to it, we
    must needs have had some kind of intelligence of it: besides, no rising
    follows it, nor any army appears anywhere to second such a design.
    Above all, there hath been no attempt upon the King or Duke’s person,
    which might easily have been executed had this been any effect of
    treason.
  </p>

  <p>
    Men begin now everywhere to recover their spirits again and think of
    repairing the old and rebuilding a new City. I am told this day by
    Mr. Chichely the City have sent to the King to desire a new model.
    Vaults are daily opened wherein are found immense quantities of
    pepper, spices, and wines, oils and sugars, etc., safe and untouched,
    though the houses were fired: but all the cloth laid in St. Faith’s
    Church under St. Paul’s is burnt. Gresham College is set apart for
    an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
    Exchange and Post Office. Leadenhall is to supply the uses of
    Guildhall; and without doubt, when the Parliament meets, as much will
    be done towards the restoring of the City, and in it of the kingdom, to
    its ancient lustre and esteem, as can be expected from the piety and
    policy of so dutiful an assembly.”

    The fourth eye-witness whom I shall quote is a certain Edward Atkyns in
    a letter preserved in the <cite>London and Middlesex Note-book</cite> (p. 171):—

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “<span class="smcap">Good Brother</span>—I received your letter and shall give you
      ye best account I can of our late sad fire, though it is scarcely
      possible for any man fully to describe it. It began at a Baker’s
      house in Pudding Lane, near Thames Street, on Sunday morning about
      2 or 3 of ye clock: and burnt doone several houses, but could not
      be quencht in regard it was a narrow place where engines could
      not play, and ye Lord Maior did not think fit to pull doone eny
      houses to prevent ye further spreading of ye fire: about 10 of ye
      clock, whilst we were at church, there was a cry in the streets yt
      ye Dutch and French were in armes, and had fired the Citty, and
      therefore ye Ministers dismist their several congregations, but
      wee yt were soe remote thought little of it. In the afternoon I
      went into the temple garden, where I saw it had made an unhappy
      progresse, and had consumed towards the Thames side many houses
      and 2 or 3 churches, as Laurence Pointney Church, which I saw
      strongly fired, and other churches, and at last growing violent,
      and meeting with many wharfes, and the wind being high, it grew
      very formidable, and we began to thinke of its nearer approach.
      By Monday morning it had burnt doone all Thames Street, New Fish
      Street, and some part of Cannon Street, and thereupon ye Citizens
      began to neglect ye fire, and in fine, and to be short, by
      Wednesday evening it had burnt all the City: yesterday I went from
      St. Dunstan’s Church to Bpgates Street, and there is not one house
      standing betwixt those places, there one only within the wall,
      but a part of these 3 streets remaining, viz. part of Leadenhall
      Street, Basinghall and Bpgates Street, all the rest burnt to the
      ground, and not so much as a considerable piece of timber as I
      could see saved from the fire: it is impossible almost to conceive
      the total destruction, all the churches burnt, nay, some of ye
      churches, as Bow Church and ... have not so much as the walls
      standing: all the Halls, as Guild-hall, Merchant Taylors, Mercers
      Chapel, Old Exchange, burnt downe to the ground, soe yt you can
      hardly tell where such a Parish or place was: I can say but this,
      that there is nothing but stones and rubbish, and all exposed to
      the open aire, soe yt you may see from one end of ye Citty almost
      to the other. St. Paul’s Church, ye very stones, are crumbled and
      broken into shivers, and slatts, and you can compare London (were
      yt not for ye rubbish) to nothing more than an open field. The
      Citizens were forced to remove their goods into the open fields,
      and £2:10 a Cart was no deare value to carry away ye goods, the
      inner Temple almost all burnt, and pulled down except ye Temple
      Church, ye Hall much defaced, and ye Exchequer Office, Sergeants
      Inn in Fleet Street, and all to St. Dunstan’s
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>Church, and soe on
      ye other side to Holborne Bridge: ye King and Duke of Yorke were
      exceedingly active, or otherwise I doubt the suburbs would have
      undergone ye same calamity. Some have conceived it was a plott,
      but most, and ye King himself, believed yt it was only ye Hand of
      God. Ye King comforts ye Citizens with ye rebuilding of ye Citty,
      but God knows when yt will be: ye Exchange is now kept at Gresham
      College, where I heard yesterday there was a full exchange of
      Merchants. My father’s house at St. Ellens stands well; the fire
      began to seize upon Chancery Lane, having burnt up Fetter Lane, and
      came as far as Brides Lane and Whites Alley, but, blessed be God,
      suppressed, and all things safe at your house and chambers: but Mr.
      Hainson of Cateaton Street Mr. Lowe has enquired for, and cannot
      hear of him, his house suffered the same calamity. Dr. Tillotson
      has lost many goods and £100 worth of books: he has taken a house
      in Lincoln’s Inn Fields, where his father-in-law purposes to
      remain. 40,000 quarters of Corne destroyed in Bridewell—being the
      City—store. Sir William Backhouse has lost £1600 per an. in houses
      and in the benefit of ye New River. Sir R. Lucy and ye Lady Allen
      and Lady Fairfax about 3 or 400 per an. Sir Richard Browne’s house
      burnt to the ground, where he has sustained great losses, and my
      brother Broone likewise, for my sister being then ill, all the care
      was to remove her. They and all now at ye Red Lyon, Holborne, my
      sister at her sister Howards house at Rockhampton. My father came
      up on Monday, and staid removing his goods till Wednesday morning,
      and I sat up all ye night, but through Mercy, Chancery Lane is
      yet standing, except St. John’s Head next Lincolns ... was pulled
      doone by way of prevention, and another house towards Holborne.
      The Parliament will certainly meet at ye day: ye Duke of Albemarle
      is now in London. There was a flying report of an engagement at
      sea, but not confirmed. Several persons, foreigners, are in prison
      upon suspicion, but little will be made of it, as I am informed
      the Attorney-General very ill. My father and his family are well
      at Albany, where my wife went on Thursday last. I had gone my
      circuit and my last two counties this week, but ye fire prevented
      my intentions. If we cannot find out your cousin Harrison I’le go
      to Totnam on Tuesday next and inquire after him, and how it stands
      in reference to your goods in his custody; but I believe he having
      notice sufficient, and being a prudent man, has secured both his
      owne and youre goods. Houses are now at an excessive value, and my
      Lord Treasurer’s new buildings are now in great request. I think
      it best yt you remove noe goods either in your house or chambers,
      for I doe believe ye danger is well over, only we have frequent
      alarms of fire, sometimes in one place and then in another: it only
      now burns in cellars and warehouses, where either coals, spirits,
      or other combustible matters were lodged. I thinke it convenient
      yt you be here agst the sitting of Parliament, for there will be
      need of you: great watch is kept, for though the judgements of God
      have been soe remarkable, yet you would wonder at ye profaneness of
      people, and how little some <span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
      are concerned in this sad calamity.
      My hearty service to my sister and nephew, Sir Robert: my father
      writt a letter this week to you, but no post went, and I cannot
      come at ye letter. My mother has had a great loss in her house by
      Ludgate—for what service I can perform pray command me. My paper
      bids me end. Our navy is come into St. Helen’s Bay.—I am your ever
      loving brother, most ready to serve you,

  </blockquote>

  <p>The following account is from Dean Milman’s <cite>Annals of St. Paul’s</cite>.</p>

  <p>
    “A certain Doctor Taswell remembered well the awful event, for it
    happened between his election and admission as a king’s scholar at
    Westminster. It was likely to be graven deeply on the memory of a
    boy. ‘On Sunday between ten and eleven, just as I was standing upon
    the steps leading up to the pulpit in Westminster Abbey, I discovered
    some people below me, running to and fro in a seeming inquietude and
    consternation; immediately almost a report reached my ears that London
    was in a conflagration. Without any ceremony I took leave of the
    preacher, and having ascended the Parliament steps near the Thames, I
    soon perceived four boats crowded with objects of distress. These had
    escaped from the fire scarce under any covering but that of a blanket.’
  </p>

  <p>
    The next day (Monday) Dolben, then Dean of Westminster, set gallantly
    forth at the head of the Westminster boys (the Dean, by Taswell’s
    account, had frequently in the civil wars mounted guard as sentinel)
    to do what they could to render assistance in staying the fire. They
    went a long way, for they aided in saving the Church of St. Dunstan in
    the East by fetching water from the back sides of the building, and so
    extinguishing the fire. Taswell acted as a sort of aide-de-camp page to
    the Dean. During this expedition Taswell may have heard or seen what
    he relates about St. Paul’s. ‘The people who lived contiguous to St.
    Paul’s Church raised their expectations greatly concerning the absolute
    security of that place upon account of the immense thickness of its
    walls and its situation, built on a large piece of ground on every
    side remote from houses.’ Upon that account they filled it with all
    sorts of goods; and besides, in the Church of St. Faith, under that of
    St. Paul, they deposited libraries of books, because it was entirely
    arched over; and with great caution and prudence even the least avenue,
    through which the smallest spark could penetrate, was stopped up.
    ‘But,’ Taswell proceeds, ‘this precaution availed them little. As I
    stood upon the bridge (a small one over a creek at the foot of what is
    now Westminster Bridge), among many others, I could not but observe the
    progress of the fire towards that venerable fabric. About eight o’clock
    it broke out on the top of St. Paul’s Church, almost scorched up by
    the violent heat of the air and lightning too, and before nine blazed
    so conspicuously as to enable me to read very clearly a 16mo. edition
    of Terence which I carried in my pocket.’ This was on Tuesday 4th; on
    Thursday, like a bold boy, Taswell, soon after sunrising, endeavoured
    to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
    reach St. Paul’s. ‘The ground was so hot as almost to scorch my
    shoes, and the air so intensely warm, that unless I had stopped some
    time upon Fleet Bridge to rest myself, I must have fainted under the
    extreme languor of my spirits. After giving myself a little time to
    breathe, I made the best of my way to St. Paul’s.
  </p>

  <p>
    And now let any person judge of the extreme emotion I was in when
    I perceived the metal belonging to the bells melting, the ruinous
    condition of the walls, with heaps of stones, of a large circumference,
    tumbling down with a great noise just upon my feet, ready to crush
    me to death. I prepared myself for retiring back again, having first
    loaded my pockets with several pieces of bell-metal.
  </p>

  <p>
    I forgot to mention that near the east end of St. Paul’s’ (he must
    have got quite round the church) ‘a human body presented itself to me,
    parched up as it were with the flames, white as to skin, meagre as to
    flesh, yellow as to colour. This was an old decrepit woman who fled
    here for safety, imagining the flames would not have reached her there;
    her clothes were burned, and every limb reduced to a coal. In my way
    home I saw several engines which were bringing up to its assistance,
    all on fire, and those engaged with them escaping with all eagerness
    from the flames, which spread instantaneous almost like a wildfire, and
    at last, <em>accoutred with my sword and helmet</em>, which I picked up among
    many others in the ruins, I traversed this torrid zone back again.’
  </p>

  <p>
    Taswell relates that the papers from the books in St. Faith’s were
    carried with the wind as far as Eton. The Oxonians observed the rays of
    the sun tinged with an unusual kind of redness, a black darkness seemed
    to cover the whole atmosphere. To impress this more deeply on Taswell’s
    memory, his father’s house was burned and plundered by officious
    persons offering to aid.”

  <p class="noindent">
    <span class="smcap">Let</span> us turn to London rebuilt after the Fire. The City now began to
    grow outside the walls with determination; it was found impossible to
    stop its expansion any longer. London spread out long arms and planted
    colonies, so to speak; the craftsmen, driven out of their old quarters
    in the City by the increase of trade, and consequently of warehouses,
    quays, shops, and offices, settled down in the new colonies. The City
    joined hands with Westminster; it ran houses along Holborn to the
    Tyburn Road; it reared a suburb at Bloomsbury; it turned Clerkenwell
    into a crowded town; it made settlements at Ratcliffe, Mile End, and
    Stepney; it created a river-side population beyond Wapping (<i>see</i>
    <a href="#APPENDIX_VI">Appendix VI</a>.)
  </p>

  <p>
    The map of Porter, <i xml:lang="la">circa</i> 1660 (London Topographical Society, 1898),
    shows us the suburbs of that date.
  </p>

  <p>
    Beginning with the east, we find a continuous line of houses “on the
    wall between St. Katherine’s and Limehouse.” Wapping contains two
    streets parallel with the river; at intervals there are stairs. What
    was afterwards Ratcliffe Highway is a broad road with cottages on
    either side, half a mile long; on the north of this road are fields
    intersected by country lanes. Stepney Church stands in the middle of
    fields. In the Whitechapel Road there are no houses beyond the church.
    On the north-east of the Tower is a broad open area, on the north of
    which stand, apparently, some of the remains of Eastminster. In the
    Minories, however, we look in vain for the ruins of the nunnery,
    though these were undoubtedly still standing at the time. Petticoat
    Lane, running into Wentworth Street, is the only street leading out of
    Whitechapel. On the north of Wentworth Street are the Spittle Fields;
    the Cloister and Cross of St. Mary Spital are visible. Lines of houses
    run north along Bishopsgate Street as far as Shoreditch Church.
  </p>

  <p>
    North-east of Moorfields are Finsbury Fields. Cripplegate Without and
    Clerkenwell are thickly populated, including the Barbican, Chiswell,
    Red Cross, White Cross, and Grub Street. Goswell Street, as far north
    as the Charterhouse, Little Britain, Long Lane, and St. John Street,
    West Smithfield, were enclosed. There were
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span> houses as far west as St.
    Giles’s. Between Holborn and the Strand, or Fleet Street, lay Fetter
    Lane and Chancery Lane; between them large gardens; Lincoln’s Inn
    Fields was an open area of irregular shape, the gardens of Lincoln’s
    Inn occupying the same position as to-day. New Inn and Clement’s Inn
    have a garden behind them; Drury Lane is an open road; Covent Garden is
    the “Piazzo.” Along the river-side are Bridewell, Whitefriars, nearly
    all a garden; the Temple, Essex House, Arundel House, Somerset House,
    The Savoy, Worcester House, Durham House, Buckingham House, Northampton
    House, Whitehall, each in its own broad garden. There are no houses
    in Pall Mall; none in the Haymarket, except a “Gaming House” in the
    north-east corner. Piccadilly is “Pecadilly Mall” without a single
    house. Westminster consists of King Street and the lanes round the
    Abbey.

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    On the south side there is a fringe of houses on the river wall,
    forming a street extending for nearly a mile east of London Bridge;
    there are houses in “Barmisie” Lane; a single street, ending with St.
    George’s Church; another fringe of houses west of the Bridge, nearly
    as far as the bend of the river to the south. A theatre is still
    standing—or is it a house for bear-baiting?—apparently on the site
    of the Globe. There is a strange and unexpected street, with houses
    on either side, in the very middle of Lambeth Marsh. And with these
    exceptions, and a few cottages dotted
    about, there are no houses
    south of the river at all. The whole of the low-lying ground is covered
    with gardens, orchards, and meadows.

  <p>
    Turning now to the new London as it was after the Fire, we have
    Ogilby’s excellent map of 1677 (<i>see</i> Map) showing the whole of London
    from Somerset House to St. Katherine by the Tower, and from the
    river to Clerkenwell, Chiswell Street, and Norton Folgate. It does
    not, indeed, include Westminster or Southwark. This map is an exact
    survey of the town as it was during the latter part of the seventeenth
    century, making allowance for some increase of houses in the northern
    suburbs. It is on the large scale of 100 feet to the inch; it presents
    every building, every street, and every lane, court, and alley. It
    consists of twenty sheets. I propose to pass this map under review,
    taking the streets in line from west to east.
  </p>

  <p>
    The area of the City within the walls, according to Ogilby, was 380
    acres; including the Liberties, it was 680 acres; the length from
    Temple Bar to Whitechapel Bar is 9256 feet, or one mile, six furlongs,
    and a pole; the breadth from the Bars of Bishopsgate to the Bridge 4653
    feet, or seven furlongs and two poles. If we include the suburbs, the
    distance between Blackwall inclusive and St. James’s Street is nearly
    six miles; between St. Leonard’s, Shoreditch, and the end of Blackman
    Street, Southwark, is two and a half miles.
  </p>

  <p>
    In Clerkenwell, we observe, taking St. James’s Church as a centre, that
    on the north side, apparently on the site of the Cloister, there lies
    a garden surrounded by buildings named “The Duke of Newcastle.” On
    the south-east side is the churchyard; on the west and south-west are
    Clerkenwell Close and Clerkenwell Green. A hundred yards north-west of
    the church stands the “New Corporation Court Yard” with its “Bridewell
    Yard” and the “New Prison Walk” leading to it. Behind the Court Yard
    is a “Churchyard for Clerkenwell.” Beyond and west of the Court are
    bowling fields, ponds—one of them a ducking pond—pasture lands, and
    private gardens; the houses are few. In the south part, however, round
    Hockley in the Hole, at the east end of which is a pond, the houses
    stand thickly with small gardens and open courts. Clerkenwell Green
    leads into St. John Street where the Inns begin. Here are the White
    Horse Yard and the Red Bull Yard; here are Aylesbury House and Gardens,
    500 feet long by 200 feet broad. The east side of the street is lined
    with houses, apparently of the humbler kind, for they have no gardens
    and are divided by narrow alleys or lanes. On the north lie “Gardiners’
    Gardens,” that is, market gardens. Between St. John’s Street and
    Goswell Street are fields and woods, belonging to the Charter House.
    Old Street runs out of Goswell Street, and like the east side of that
    street and the east side of St. John’s Street, it is lined with small
    houses and narrow alleys. Between Goswell Street and Bunhill Fields
    lies a quarter thickly inhabited and covered with houses. Golden
    Lane and White Cross Street run across this district in a north-west
    direction. Between the two streets, on the north of Playhouse Yard,
    is a churchyard, and on the Bunhill side are gardens behind the
    houses; the largest of them is not more than 80 feet square. There is
    no church in this thickly populated area, more than a quarter of a
    mile long by nearly as much broad. It is evidently a place inhabited
    by the craftsmen, most of whom have ceased to live any longer in the
    City. The houses and gardens of Bunhill overlooking the “New Artillery
    Garden” remind us that many of the citizens had already begun to live
    out of town. Continuing east, beyond the Artillery Garden, we find
    Upper Moorfields, with trees planted on all four sides and paths
    intersecting; a large area called “Butchers’ Close or Tenter Field,”
    and a thickly built part bounded on the north by Hog Lane, and on the
    east by Norton Folgate. Here, again, the abundance of narrow alleys and
    the houses without gardens proclaim a humble population. Shoreditch
    is lined with houses; on its east side lies a large open space called
    Porter Close, with Spital Fields beyond. Two or three streets are
    fully built, but the vacant spaces are many and wide. No church is on
    this part of the map, except St. Leonard’s, Shoreditch. We observe on
    the west of Norton Folgate two or three of the little streams which
    formerly ran across the moor here; they lie open for a little space and
    then disappear again.

    The second line of maps carries us from east to west in the latitude of
    Gray’s Inn. The only buildings of the Inn are South Square, Gray’s Inn
    Square, and the Hall and Chapel. The rest of the Inn is planted thickly
    with trees, or lies open, a beautiful garden. Not far to the east of
    Gray’s Inn are the great gardens of Furnival’s Inn. Between Gray’s Inn
    Road and the Fleet River lies a quarter thickly populated on the west
    and the east, but with many open spaces, especially on either side
    of Hatton Garden and Saffron Hill. What were these open spaces? They
    were not gardens, or the fact would have been indicated; they were not
    enclosed. Were they simply open spaces, the playground of children, the
    retreat of pickpockets? In this place, apparently, no gentlefolk dwelt,
    and there is no church.
  </p>

  <p>
    We now cross over the Fleet and find ourselves in the classic regions
    of Turnmill Street, Cow Cross, and Chick Lane. Here, however, we are
    in a suburb which has been occupied and partly built over since the
    twelfth century. North of Chick Lane is the new churchyard of St.
    Sepulchre’s, re-discovered recently when excavations took place which
    revealed stacks of human bones regularly laid and piled. I believe
    that these bones were moved from the old churchyard, which seems the
    only way to account for their great number, and the regular method
    of laying them. They have now been moved to some consecrated ground,
    and the place is built over. St. John’s Lane leads to St. John’s
    Gate, and Berkeley House and Gardens are on the west side; the great
    houses of the Elizabethan period are replaced by mean tenements. On
    the south side of St. John’s Street is “Hix’s” Hall. Further south,
    again, passing through the Bars, we are in Smithfield. The church of
    Little St. Bartholomew was not yet within the Hospital; that of St.
    Bartholomew the Great shows the ambulatory and the Lady Chapel, but
    not the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
    transepts. Charter House shows the Courts as at present; on
    the east side of Charterhouse Yard are the houses and gardens of the
    Marquis of Dorchester and Lord Gray. St. Bartholomew’s Close is a large
    open space; Cloth Fair and the narrow streets around it are much the
    same to-day as then; the whole area is covered with narrow alleys and
    courts with narrow openings. Between Aldersgate Street and Little Moor
    Fields lies a suburb thickly built over except on the northern portion
    south of Chiswell Street, where the houses are more scattered and
    there are gardens and, apparently, small fields. The same remarkable
    abundance of open courts approached by narrow passages that has been
    already mentioned may be observed here. East of Aldersgate, and just
    under the wall at the Cripplegate angle, are the gardens of Thanet
    House. North of Barbican are those of Bridgewater House. St. Giles’s
    Church has taken over a part of the town ditch for an extension of its
    churchyard; the wall is encroached upon on both sides by buildings,
    but a strip on the south side is still left free from buildings. As
    regards the portion of the City included in this street, it will be
    noticed farther on. The upper field has trees planted along its sides
    and diagonally from point to point shading two intersecting fields;
    the lower field has also trees along its sides and two paths across
    at right angles, also planted with trees. On these fields the people
    turned out by the Fire encamped until they could rebuild their houses;
    it is, however, impossible to describe the great number of streets east
    and west of the Fields, without feeling sure that the houses afforded
    lodgings, better or worse, for the great majority of the homeless. On
    the south of Moorfields stood the New Bethlehem Hospital, a long narrow
    building on the outside of the wall, a piece of which has been cut down
    to afford an entrance from the City. The old churchyard of Bethlehem,
    about 200 feet by 300 feet, lay on the north-east side of Lower
    Moorfields; the site of St. Mary Bethlehem is preserved in the name of
    a street or court: “Bethlehem”—between the yard and Bishopsgate Street
    Without. St. Botolph’s without Bishopsgate has taken a large piece of
    the town ditch for an extension of churchyard; the lane running along
    its north side leads into Petty France, now called North Broad Street.
    All the ground about this part is now swallowed up by the Liverpool
    and Broad Street Stations. Bishopsgate Street Without, with the ground
    east and west, is completely built up and covered with houses. The site
    of Old Artillery Garden is still marked by Artillery Lane, which led
    into it. East of Bishopsgate Street we find Petticoat Lane, Wentworth
    (then called Wentford) Street, Brick Lane, Carter Street, Fashion
    Street, Dean and Tower Streets, and other streets and lanes, lined with
    houses but not yet filled in with courts; the houses, in nearly all
    cases, have gardens behind them. One wishes for a drawing of one of
    these early Whitechapel streets, but in vain. Tenter fields fill up the
    spaces not yet built over.
  </p>

  <p>
    We next come to the third line of maps. On the north of this line runs
    the noble highway of Holborn; on its north side we pass Warwick House,
    Gray’s Inn;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
    and Brook House, evidently a stately building in the form
    of a court, with a gateway to the street and gardens behind; this is
    separated from Furnival’s Inn by a narrow lane. The Inn, whose gardens
    we have already noticed, presents in plan an oblong outer court, a
    hall and chapel, and an unfinished inner court; Ely House has a court,
    gardens and buildings, and a hall. In the street itself stands the
    Middle Row, only taken down a few years ago; at its east end, and just
    west of Staple Inn, are the Holborn Bars. We next observe Chancery
    Lane; its west side is largely taken up with Lincoln’s Inn. The Inn
    itself consists of the first two courts, the chapel, and the hall; the
    rest is all garden, open on the east to Chancery Lane, and on the west
    to the Fields. Lincoln’s Inn Fields are not enclosed and are crossed by
    paths; the south side is occupied by “Portugal Row.” South of the Inn,
    on the ground now covered by part of New Square and by part of the High
    Courts of Justice, is an open space called Lower Lincoln’s Inn Fields,
    the existence of which appears to have been neglected by writers on
    topography. On the east side of Chancery Lane there are continuous
    houses, and behind them the gardens of Staple Inn, the Rolls with the
    Master’s house, the chapel, and the gardens.
  </p>

  <p>
    Following the south side of Holborn we find Staple Inn, much as it is
    at the present day, but with fine and spacious gardens; Barnard’s Inn,
    as it was before it was turned into a school; Fetter Lane, where most
    of the houses still had gardens; Thavies Inn, with its two courts and
    its small garden; and St. Andrew’s Church and Churchyard. The labyrinth
    of undistinguished streets called Harding Street, New Street, etc., is
    almost the same in 1677 as at present, save that it was not as yet the
    Printers’ Quarter.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the end of Holborn is Holborn Bridge, crossing the Fleet, which is
    here called the New Canal; barges and boats lie upon it. At the back
    of the street now called Farringdon Street, facing the stream, are
    two burial yards, one belonging to St. Andrew’s, Holborn; the other,
    lower down, to St. Bride’s, Fleet Street; on the west side a great
    number of narrow streets branch off to the east, ending at Snow Hill
    and the Old Bailey. Newgate Prison lies north and south of the Gate,
    quite separated from the court. The Gate and wall crossed the road 200
    yards east of Giltspur Street. Passing over Holborn Bridge we can walk
    up Snow Hill, which leads us to St. Sepulchre’s Church and Newgate,
    or we can keep straight on through Cock Lane to Giltspur Street, Pie
    Corner, and St. Bartholomew’s and Smithfield. The Hospital consists
    apparently of one court only. Three large churchyards lie round it:
    that of St. Bartholomew the Less; that called “Bartholomew Churchyard,”
    and the “Hospital Churchyard,” on the site of the town ditch. In front
    of Newgate Prison stood a block of buildings like the Middle Row of
    Holborn, Butcher’s Row in the Strand, or Holywell Street; on the west
    side the narrow street was called the Little Old Bailey. Among the
    courts leading out of the Little Old Bailey we observe Green Arbour
    Court, afterwards the residence of Oliver Cromwell.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span></p>

  <p>The next sheet is altogether within the City.</p>

  <p>
    We then come to Aldgate and Whitechapel. The eastern limits of the map
    run through Goodman’s Fields, in 1677 really open fields. We observe
    that from Aldgate to the Tower, the site of the town ditch is still
    left open. A broad space not built over lies across the site of the
    Minories.
  </p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    The last line of streets begins with Somerset House. Taking the north
    side we find Lyon’s Inn between Holywell Street and Wych Street;
    Clement’s Inn and New Inn, side by side, each with its two courts
    and its garden; Butcher Row, built in the middle of the Strand, and
    a labyrinth of courts, lanes, and yards lying between Clement’s Inn
    and Bell Yard, the whole now occupied by the High Courts of Justice;
    Clifford’s Inn lies north of St. Dunstan’s Church in Fleet Street.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the south side we get Somerset House and Gardens, soon to be
    all built over; the two Temples with their gardens—a vast number
    of wherries are waiting at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
    the Temple Stairs—and the Whitefriars
    Precinct, between Whitefriars Lane and Water Lane, where there is a
    dock for barges. St. Bride’s is called St. Bridget’s; the Palace of
    Bridewell, with its two courts and two gateways, is represented as
    still standing. The Duke’s Theatre on the south-east side of Salisbury
    Court perhaps accounts for the number of wherries gathered at the
    stairs.
  </p>

  <p>
    Passing over the City we come to the Tower, and beyond the Tower to
    the eastern boundary of our map. As to the crowded lanes and courts on
    the other side of the Tower, there is nothing to say about them; they
    belong to the Precinct of St. Katherine, now almost entirely converted
    into a dock.
  </p>

  <p>
    We have thus gone all round the City from Somerset House west to St.
    Katherine’s east, and from the City wall on the south to Clerkenwell on
    the north. These were no longer rural retreats or villages; they were,
    for the most part, completely built over and laid out in streets; there
    were among them half a dozen noblemen’s houses. As there were none left
    in the City, it is certain that the former connection between the City
    and the nobility had been well-nigh destroyed; but not quite. Prince
    Rupert is said to have lived in the Barbican, and there are still the
    houses we have found in Ogilby and those along the riverside between
    the Temple and Westminster. In all these suburbs there are as yet no
    new churches, and for all these crowded suburbs, only ten old churches.
    There are few schools. In the seventeenth century was begun the fatal
    neglect of the populace, formerly living in the City under surveillance
    and discipline, taught, trained, and kept in their place. This was
    the creating cause of the terrible London mob of the next century.
    What could be expected, when a vast population was allowed to grow up
    without guidance, without instruction, without religion, and without
    even a police? We observe also that outside the City there was a great
    number of market gardens, with gardens at the back of every house until
    the space is wanted, when courts and alleys are run into them. The
    Londoner always loved a garden, and had one as long as he could (<i>see</i>
    <a href="#APPENDIX_VII">Appendix VII</a>.).
  </p>

  <p>
    Let us next, very briefly, consider the City of 1677 as represented
    by this map. It is eleven years after the Fire. It is sometimes
    stated, loosely, that it took a great many years to rebuild London.
    The statement is only true as regards the churches and the companies’
    halls. The City itself was rebuilt with every possible despatch.
    As for the plans prepared by Wren and Evelyn, they came under the
    consideration of the Council after the people had begun with feverish
    haste to clear away the rubbish and to rebuild. The actual alterations
    made by order of the Mayor were carefully enumerated by Maitland, and
    will be found in their place (<a href="#APPENDIX_V">Appendices V</a>. and <a href="#APPENDIX_VI">VI</a>.).
  </p>

  <p>
    We must remember that the people, deprived of their shops and their
    warehouses, huddled together in temporary huts erected on Moorfields,
    with the winter before them, or lodged in the mean tenements of the
    suburbs, living on bounty and charity, were eager to get back to their
    own places. Every man claimed his own
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span> ground; every heap of rubbish
    was the site of a house; every house had its owner or its tenant;
    without a workshop or his counter there was no means of making a
    livelihood. Therefore, even before the ashes were cooled, the people
    were picking their way through the encumbered lanes, crying “Mine!
    Mine!” and shovelling away the rubbish in order to put up the walls
    anew. The improvements ordered by the Mayor were not, one fears,
    carried out exactly; we know by sad experience the difficulty of
    getting such an order or a regulation obeyed. If we look into Ogilby’s
    map we see plainly that as regards the streets and courts, London after
    the Fire was very much the same as London before the Fire; there were
    the same narrow streets, the same crowded alleys, the same courts and
    yards. Take, for instance, the small area lying between Bread Street
    Hill on the west and Garlick Hill on the east, between Trinity Lane
    on the north and Thames Street on the south: is it possible to crowd
    more courts and alleys into this area? Can we believe that after the
    Fire London was relieved of its narrow courts with this map before us?
    Look at the closely-shut-in places marked on the maps, “1 g., m. 46,
    m. 47, m. 48, m. 40.” These are respectively, Jack Alley, Newman’s
    Rents, Sugar Loaf Court, Three Cranes Court, and Cowden’s Rents. Some
    of these courts survive to this day. They were formed, as the demand
    for land grew, by running narrow lanes
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span> between the backs of houses
    and swallowing up the gardens. There were 479 such courts in Ogilby’s
    London of 1677, 472 alleys, and 172 yards, besides 128 inns, each of
    which, with its open courts for the standing of vehicles, and its
    galleries, stood retired from the street on a spot which had once been
    the fair garden of a citizen’s house.

  <p>
    The projecting upper stories had disappeared; wooden houses and
    thatched roofs were no longer permitted; moreover, the hot breath of
    the Fire had burned up the infected soil, the noisome laystalls, and
    the plague-smitten churchyards; the wreck and rubbish of the Fire had
    choked the wells fed from the contaminated soil: these were not, for
    the most part, reopened. As for the churches, we know the date of the
    rebuilding of every one. In 1677 there were only about twenty rebuilt
    out of all the eighty-seven which were burned down; a white square
    space on the map indicates the site of a church not yet rebuilt.
  </p>

  <p>
    The picturesqueness of London had been lost; gables, projecting
    stories, casement windows gave place to a straight façade, and flat
    square windows with sashes. In this map of 1677 we step from the
    seventeenth to the eighteenth century. And the most ardent admirer
    of Wren will hardly aver that his cathedral and his churches were
    externally more beautiful, while they were much less venerable, than
    those which they replaced.
  </p>

  <p>
    The demand for land and its value was shown in the curious way in
    which many of the churches were built. Some had houses beside and over
    the porch; some against the north or south side: as, for instance,
    the church of St. Ethelburga, which still has houses built before the
    west front; the churches of St. Peter Cornhill, St. Mary le Bow, and
    St. Michael, the church of St. Alphege, all hidden by houses. The old
    craft quarters had by this time almost disappeared. But there were
    still places which continued to keep what modern tradesmen call a
    “line.” Linen-drapers and toymen were found in Fleet Street; here also
    jewellers held raffles; mutton was sold in Newgate Market; beef in
    Leadenhall; veal at St. James’s; the cheesemongers set up their shops
    in Thames Street; second-hand booksellers round Moorfields; second-hand
    clothes-men in Monmouth Street: fruit was sold in Covent Garden;
    mercers were always faithful to Cheapside; bankers and money-lenders
    were found in Lombard Street; milliners had stalls in the upper rooms
    of the Royal and the New Exchange.
  </p>

  <p>
    The frays and feuds between the crafts, which constantly arose during
    the earlier centuries, had almost become things of the past: but in
    1664 the weavers and the butchers reminded the elders of the good old
    days by one more burst of brawling and fighting. It seems strange that
    so peaceful a creature as the weaver came oft victorious. The weavers
    marched triumphantly about the streets offering a hundred pounds for
    the production of a butcher, and the blue smocks stayed at home in the
    shambles of Newgate, inglorious and defeated. And a butcher, too! a man
    of blood and slaughter! The streets, with the exception of Cheapside
    and Ludgate Hill, were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
    not used by ladies as a place of walking and
    meeting. The merchants met on ’Change; the lawyers had their Inns of
    Court; for social and convivial purposes there were the taverns. Nor
    were the streets used greatly for purposes of locomotion; if a man
    wished to go from the Tower stairs to Blackfriars or from the Temple
    to Westminster, he took a boat; the Thames was, and continued until
    the nineteenth century, the great highway of the City; thousands of
    boats and barges plied up and down the river; the old ferry—the ferry
    of St. Mary Overies—still crossed the river above the bridge; that
    called the Horseferry still crossed the river at Westminster. It was
    a great deal easier and shorter to take oars than to walk, to ride,
    or to take a “glass coach”: one of the newly invented machines which
    replaced the old coach, with its perforated sides for windows. No one
    thought it a scandal that the watermen on the river should exchange
    language which in these days would drive every decent man or woman from
    the boats for ever. It was natural that rough and coarse men, like the
    watermen, should use rough and coarse language. The ladies of Charles
    the Second’s time heard coarseness unparalleled from these fellows
    with much the same air with which ladies of our own time pass a group
    of working-men energetically strengthening every assertion with the
    universal adjective. They hear, but they do not hear.

    As we already know, shooting London Bridge was a dangerous feat except
    at high and low water. Some of the boats were tilt boats, covered,
    that is, with a tilt or awning of canvas to keep off the rain; they
    were a kind of omnibus, and ran between Greenwich and London, with
    other lines. Most of them, however, were wherries of the kind which
    still survive, though they are now little used. It is melancholy to
    look at the river of to-day above Bridge and to compare its silence
    and loneliness with the animation and bustle of two hundred years ago,
    when it was covered with boats taking passengers up and down the river,
    barges with parties, stately barges of the Mayor and the Companies,
    Royal barges, cargo-freighted barges, boats with anglers moored in mid
    stream, tilt boats, sailing boats, and every conceivable kind of small
    craft. When the Queen came down from Hampton Court ten thousand boats
    accompanied her.

    We read a great deal about the insanitary condition of the City, the
    narrow lanes, the projecting storeys nearly meeting at the top, the
    laystalls and the stinking heaps of offal and refuse, which were not
    abolished by the Fire but only burnt up. No doubt these things were
    bad; probably they contributed to the spread of the Plague. However,
    the City was as healthy as any town in the world, as cities then went;
    it stood upon a broad tidal river which swept up a fresh wind with
    every tide—twice a day; the City was less than half a mile in breadth,
    and on all sides it was surrounded by open spaces and broad moorland.
    Fresh pure air on every side, without a town to speak of for twenty
    miles around. Moreover it stood upon a hill, or many hills; the ground
    sloped to the river and to the two streams; the climate had always been
    rainy, and the rain washed the streets and carried away the decaying
    matter.
  </p>

  <p>
    There were public latrines in the streets and cesspools at the back of
    every house; carts went about for the collection and removal of things
    which require removal; they emptied their contents sometimes in the
    river, unless they were stopped; sometimes in “laystalls,” of which
    there continued to be many outside the walls. One need do no more than
    indicate the sanitary condition of a great town without any sewers.
  </p>

  <p>
    Pepys, in one of his observations upon the effects of the Fire, says
    that the Royal Exchange “is now made pretty” by having windows and
    doors before all the shops to keep off the cold. So that before 1666
    the shops in the Royal Exchange were mere stalls open to the cold and
    wind. This, I take it, was the condition of nearly all the shops at
    that time; they had no doors, and if any glass in front, then only in
    the upper parts.

    <span class="smcap">In</span> considering the manners and customs of London during the seventeenth
    century we are met with the difficulty that a long civil war, followed
    by a visitation of Plague and a dreadful Fire, cuts the periods into
    two parts, and that after the war is over and the King restored we
    find great changes, in religious thought and ideas, in manners and
    customs, in society and fashions. The seventeenth corresponds in this
    respect with the nineteenth century; in our own time we have emerged
    out of eighteenth-century ideas, which prevailed until displaced by the
    silent though rapid revolution of the Victorian age. In the seventeenth
    century there is a similar revolution, but violent and created by the
    sword.
  </p>

  <p>
    The City of 1670, as we have seen by our study of the map, resembled
    in very few details the London of 1640. We must endeavour to bear that
    point very carefully in mind. And if we take the latter, rather than
    the former half of the century for consideration, it is because the
    former half offers little change from the London of Queen Elizabeth.
  </p>

  <p>
    The rents of houses varied, of course, with the site and the size. It
    would appear that for £30 a year one could rent a house of moderate
    size in any but the most expensive parts of the town. On Ludgate Hill
    or in Cheapside the rents were a great deal higher.
  </p>

  <p>
    Of the furniture in such a house I have an inventory belonging to the
    year 1680. There were four bedrooms. One of these, the principal room,
    was furnished with a carved bedstead, which had a canopy and a valence;
    curtains, a looking-glass, and four chairs. The other three bedrooms
    were less splendidly furnished. There was, however, a plentiful supply
    of blankets, pillows, bolsters, and feather beds. There were two
    parlours. One of these was hung with tapestry; curtains of green cloth
    and a green carpet adorned it; it contained two tables, a clock case,
    a leather chair, a plush chair, six green cloth chairs, and two green
    stools. There was a cupboard and one of the tables had a drawer. The
    other parlour was more simply furnished, and was hung with grey linsey
    woolsey and gilt leather.

    Carpets were advertised for sale in 1660; they were Turkey carpets and
    intended for the cover of tables; for the floors there was matting in
    those houses where rushes were not still used. Oil-cloth was introduced
    about the same time; made “after the German manner” either of linen,
    cloth, taffeta, or wool.

    Hangings of leather and of velvet were commonly used; the furniture
    with tables not laid on trestles but provided with carved and decorated
    supports; chairs with inlaid work and carving richly upholstered;
    couches, sideboards, stools, all carved; paintings richly framed
    hanging from the walls show a great advance on the Tudor time.

    The inventory of the kitchen shows that pewter was the material
    commonly used for plates and dishes. There is no mention of china ware.
    Probably it was kept for the use of the master and mistress in the
    parlour cupboard. There are wooden platters, pewter candlesticks and
    pewter pint pots. And there is no mention of forks. Yet forks by that
    time were well known. In 1652 Heylin speaks of “the use of silver forks
    which is by some of our spruce gallants taken up of late.” It would
    seem, therefore, that twenty-five years later they had not got into
    general use.
  </p>

  <p>
    The family took breakfast at eight. The meal consisted of cold meat,
    small beer, and oat cake. This was not an invariable rule. Pepys once
    breakfasts off bread and butter, sweetmeats, and strong wine; on
    another occasion he has oysters, anchovies, and neats’ tongues. When
    Cosmo, Duke of Tuscany, visited England he had breakfast with a country
    gentleman, and it consisted almost entirely of Italian wine. Archbishop
    Sancroft used to take two cups of coffee and a pipe of tobacco. A
    learned physician recommended for breakfast two poached eggs, bread and
    butter, and a cup of claret.
  </p>

  <p>
    The amount of small beer consumed in every household was enormous. It
    must be remembered that it was not only the national beverage, but,
    for a great many people, the only beverage. Children drank it as well
    as adults; tea was as yet only a luxury or a fashion. The household of
    which I am speaking drank three quarts of beer a day for every member.
    It seems impossible. We must remember, however, that people drank a
    great deal more then than now—a thing of which I have no direct proof,
    yet of which I am perfectly satisfied; that breakfast, dinner, and
    supper would easily account for two quarts, and the remaining quart was
    spread over the rest of the day. Benjamin Franklin’s fellows in the
    printing office drank each his three quarts a day.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ale, of which there were various kinds, and wine were served in the
    best parlour at dinner. On the variety of drinks Chamberlayne speaks:—
  </p>

  <p>
    “Since the late Rebellion, England hath abounded in variety of Drinks
    (as it did lately in variety of Religions) above any nation in Europe.
    Besides all sorts of the best wines from Spain, France, Italy, Germany,
    there are sold in London above twenty sorts of other Drinks, as
    Brandy, Coffee, Chocolate, Tee, Aromatick, Mum, Sider, Perry, Mede,
    Metheglin, Beer, Ale, many sorts of Ales, very different, as Cock,
    Stepony, Stich-back, Hull, North-Devon, Sambidge, Betony, Scurvy-grass,
    Sage-Ale, Colledge-Ale, etc., a piece of wantonness whereof none of our
    Ancestors were ever guilty.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Howell sends a bottle of Metheglin to a friend with a recommendation
    to use it for a morning draught. What were the heads of our
    seventeenth-century ancestors made of that they could drink this heavy,
    powerful stuff before breakfast?
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “To inaugurate a good and jovial New Year to you, I send you a
      morning’s draught, viz. a bottle of Metheglin. Neither Sir John
      Barleycorn or Bacchus had anything to do with it; but it is the
      pure juice <span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
      of the Bee, the laborious Bee, and King of Insects. The
      Druids and old British Bards were wont to take a Carouse hereof
      before they entered into their Speculations; and if you do so when
      your Fancy labours with any thing, it will do you no Hurt, and I
      know your Fancy to be very good.
    </p>

    <p>
      But this Drink always carries a kind of State with it, for it must
      be attended with a brown Toast; nor will it admit but of one good
      Draught, and that in the morning; if more, it will keep a-humming
      in the head, and so speak too much of the House it comes from, I
      mean the Hive, as I gave a caution elsewhere.”

  <p>
    Let us go on to repeat an observation forced upon us in every age, that
    London has always been a great place for good living. We learn from
    Pepys what a profusion of food was offered at a dinner given at his own
    house. The quantity of food habitually taken was much greater then than
    now. People got up earlier; though they took little exercise for the
    sake of exercise, yet they were in the open air a great deal; on the
    river quiescent; in the gardens sitting, strolling, or playing bowls;
    they all grew sleek and fat. These people had probably taken very
    little breakfast, a few radishes, a draught of small ale or claret, a
    piece of bread. The hour of dinner had advanced; it was now served at
    one o’clock, or sometimes at two; it was the principal event of the
    day. Food was simpler and less composed of made dishes than in the days
    of Whittington and Picard. We find served roast chicken, veal, mutton
    and beef, tongue, salmon, stewed carp, pies of goose, fish, turkey,
    eels, and everything else. The people served their dinner in courses,
    each course being, in fact, after the ancient custom, a complete dinner
    in itself. There was a great deal of dining together, as Pepys lets us
    see continually, and after dinner they sat and talked and drank. In the
    matter of drink they were catholic. It does not seem that the merchants
    did much business after dinner, for then began the time of rest,
    recreation, and drinking; then came the theatre or the tavern, later on
    the coffee-house, though in the evening Pepys, who was an industrious
    official, got through a good deal of work.
  </p>

  <p>
    Fresh meat was scarce, and even impossible to get, in the winter. In
    the country, and perhaps in town as well, housewives had to lay in
    a great stock of beef for pickling; it was bought in pieces and in
    quantities of 70 lbs. at a time for the pickling tub; salt beef was the
    standard winter dish, garnished with a great quantity of parsnips as a
    corrective. Children and servants had no forks; small beer was brewed
    at home, and gentlemen thought no more of a pint of wine than working
    men think now of a pint of beer.
  </p>

  <p>
    The fashion of putting the dinner on the table at once began to be
    changed soon after the Restoration, when the dishes were presented one
    after the other in some sort of order; but I find in boarding-houses
    and in private houses, long after this, the custom of putting
    everything on the table at the same time.
  </p>

  <p>
    At dinner the women sat together at the upper end and helped every one,
    conversing freely the while.
  </p>

  <p>
    We find some excellent specimens of dinners in the <cite>Diary</cite> of Pepys.
    Here is the menu of a grand dinner (April 4, 1665):—
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “A Fricasse of rabbits and chickens, a leg of mutton boiled, three
      carps on a dish, a great dish of a side of a lamb, a dish of
      roasted pigeons, a dish of four lobsters, three tarts, a lamprey
      pie (a most rare pie), a dish of anchovies, good wine of several
      sorts, and all things mighty noble and to my great content.”
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    About prices I find that a leg of mutton cost half-a-crown; a hand of
    pork eighteenpence; butter was eightpence a pound; sugar, sixpence;
    candles, fivepence; bacon, sevenpence; rice, sevenpence; tea was sixty
    shillings a pound. They seem to have had all our vegetables, all our
    fruit, and all our spices. But the fruit lasted only a short time;
    oranges appeared at Christmas, but were then unripe and sour; they
    lasted till April or May; strawberries lasted three or four weeks;
    cherries about the same time. They knew how to preserve fruit for a
    short time; and they pickled everything, including nasturtium buds,
    lime-tree buds, and elder roots. In the stillroom the housewife made
    wine out of cowslips, gooseberries, raspberries, and any kind of fruit;
    she also made certain cordials and strong waters; and she made plague
    water, hysterical water, fever water, and many other efficacious
    remedies in case of need.
  </p>

  <p>
    The supper, of which very little is said, was served at five or six; it
    was, like breakfast, a mere informal stay. Cold meat with a “sallet,” a
    tankard of strong ale, and a pipe of tobacco generally formed this meal.
  </p>

  <p>
    As additional notes on food, one may note that asparagus was common,
    but as yet very dear; goose-pie was a favourite dish; buttered shrimps
    were also much in demand; vinegar and pepper were taken with roast
    beef; the potato was in use since the year 1586, but as yet by no means
    universally known; roast mutton was stuffed with oysters; young peacock
    was a stately dish, served only on great occasions; oysters were stewed
    with white wine; pigeons were stuffed, in the season, with green
    gooseberries; radishes were taken with meat as a salad; grapes were
    boiled in butter and served with sips of bread and sugar; turkey was
    stuffed with cloves; hot salmon was thought unwholesome; dates were put
    into broth; they used habitually mushrooms, sorrel, capers, and snails.
  </p>

  <p>
    When a man gave a great dinner, he did not expect it to be prepared at
    home but ordered it at the cooks’ shops, whence it was carried through
    the streets in a kind of triumphal procession, a server with an apron
    and a white cap going before. The fiddlers and the trumpeters went
    the round of the cooks’ shops every day in order to learn where their
    services might be accepted.
  </p>

  <p>
    In Howell’s <cite>Letters</cite> we read how, on one occasion, he finds a cook for
    a lady, and thus describes his qualities:—
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “You spoke to me for a Cook who had seen the World abroad, and I
      think the Bearer hereof will suit your Ladyship’s Turn. He can
      marinate Fish, make Gellies; he is excellent for a piquant Sauce
      and the Haugot; besides, Madam, he is passing good for an Olla. He
      will tell your Ladyship that the reverend Matron the <i xml:lang="es">Olla Podrida</i>
      hath Intellectuals and Senses; Mutton, Beef, and Bacon are to her
      as the Will, Understanding, and Memory are to the Soul; Cabbage,
      Turneps, Artichokes, Potatoes and Dates are her five senses, and
      Pepper the Common-sense; she must have Marrow to keep Life in her,
      and some Birds to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
      make her light; by all means she must go adorned
      with Chains of Sausages. He is also good at larding Meat after the
      Mode of France.”
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    The reign of the tavern still continued. Most of the citizens
    frequented the tavern every day. It was complained that the tradesman,
    who ought to have been in his shop, too often spent his mornings in the
    tavern, leaving his shop to the care of his ’prentices. There were many
    men in London who, being visitors, strangers, unmarried, or houseless,
    habitually took their dinner at the tavern.

  <p>
    The ordinary price for dinners at a tavern was a shilling, but one
    might pay a great deal more; dinners could be ordered for five
    shillings, or even ten shillings a head. The most fashionable tavern
    was Locket’s at Charing Cross, where is now Drummond’s Bank. Adam
    Locket started his tavern in the reign of Charles the Second; he died
    in 1688, and was succeeded by his son, Edward Locket. It was a very
    famous tavern. Cunningham quotes a column and a half of contemporary
    mention of Locket’s house. Here is one from Price and Montague, <i>The
    Hind and Panther, Transversed</i>:—
  </p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">“Come, at a crown a head ourselves we’ll treat,</div>

      </div>
    </div>

  <p>
    It can hardly be pretended that tea was a national drink in the
    seventeenth century. It was not even a fashionable beverage. It was
    offered as a curious foreign drink, being prepared with great care
    and according to rule, and taken with a certain amount of anxiety as
    to the possible consequences. Precautions were taken against these
    consequences. Thus in Congreve’s <cite>Way of the World</cite>, Mrs. Millicent’s
    lover<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
    allows her to be “Sole Empress of her tea-table,” a reservation
    which sufficiently indicates the want of confidence in the beverage,
    and she must promise to banish from the table “orange brandy, aniseed,
    cinnamon, citron and Barbadoes water, together with ratafia and the
    most noble spirit of clary.” The price of tea, which was then about
    fifty shillings a pound, though it rapidly went down, prevented any
    but the rich from taking it. Long after this it is noticed that the
    City ladies took brandy after their tea as a corrective. The earliest
    mention of tea in this country is an advertisement in the
    <cite>Mercurius Politicus</cite> of 1658, which is as follows:—
  </p>

  <p>
    “That excellent, and by all physicians approved, China drink, called
    by the Chineans Tcha, by other nations Tay, alias Tee, is sold at
    the Sultaness Head Coffee-House, in Sweeting’s Rents, by the Royal
    Exchange, London.”
  </p>

  <p>
    And Thomas Garway or Garraway at the same time issued a broadside
    in which he offers tea to the public at sixteen shillings to fifty
    shillings the pound and proclaims its virtues:—
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “The Quality is moderately hot, proper for winter or summer. The
      drink is declared to be most wholesome, preserving in perfect
      health until extreme old age. The particular virtues are these.
      It maketh the body active and lusty. It helpeth the headache,
      giddiness and heaviness thereof. It removeth the obstructions of
      the spleen. It is very good against the stone and gravel.... It
      taketh away the difficulty of breathing, opening obstructions. It
      is good against lippitude distillations, and cleareth the sight.
      It removeth lassitude, and cleanseth and purifieth adust humours
      and a hot liver. It is good against crudities, strengthening the
      weakness of the stomach, causing good appetite and digestion, and
      particularly for men of a corpulent body, and such as are great
      eaters of flesh. It vanquisheth heavy dreams, easeth the brain,
      and strengtheneth the memory. It overcometh superfluous sleep, and
      prevents sleepiness in general, a draught of the infusion being
      taken, so that, without trouble, whole nights may be spent in study
      without hurt to the body. It prevents and cures agues, surfeits,
      and fevers by infusing a fit quantity of the leaf, thereby
      provoking a most gentle vomit and breathing of the pores, and hath
      been given with wonderful success. It (being prepared and drunk
      with milk and water) strengtheneth the inward parts and prevents
      consumptions.... It is good for colds, dropsies, and scurvies,
      and expelleth infection.... And that the virtue and excellence of
      the leaf and drink are many and great is evident and manifest by
      the high esteem and use of it (especially of late years) by the
      physicians and knowing men of France, Italy, Holland, and other
      parts of Christendom, and in England it hath been sold in the leaf
      for six pounds, and sometimes for ten pounds the pound-weight; and
      in respect of its former scarceness and dearness, it hath been
      only used as a regalia in high treatments and entertainments, and
      presents made thereof to princes and grandees till the
      year 1657” (Chambers’s <cite>Book of Days</cite>, vol. ii. p. 666).
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    Rugge’s <cite>Diurnal</cite> says that tea was sold in every street in London
    in 1659. That statement we cannot believe, especially when we are
    reminded that a couple of pounds was a present fit for the King to
    receive. A couple of pounds of a commodity sold in every street in
    London? On the contrary, there is every kind of evidence that in the
    seventeenth century tea was perhaps the fashion, but never became a
    national beverage. Pepys mentions it once or twice, but tea formed no
    part of his ordinary diet. Evelyn, I believe, does not mention it at
    all. In the winter of 1683–1684 the Thames was frozen over, and in the
    fair that was held upon the river, tea, among other things, was sold.
    No one, I think, ever imagined that tea would
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span> become the national
    beverage, excluding beer from breakfast and from the afternoon meal.
    A learned physician, Dr. Lister, writing at the close of the century,
    says that tea and coffee “are permitted by God’s Providence for
    lessening the number of mankind by shortening life, as a kind of silent
    plague.” Many attacks were made upon the tea-table. It took men away
    from the pipe and bottle; it brought together men and women inclined
    for vice and gave them an opportunity; it was very costly; it offered
    a drink only fit for women; it destroyed the strength of man and the
    beauty of woman. The hostility to tea lingered during the whole of the
    eighteenth century.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 1652 the first coffee-house was opened in St. Michael’s Alley,
    Cornhill, by one Pasqua Rosee, a native of Ragusa, servant to a Turkey
    merchant who brought him from Smyrna. Coffee had been introduced into
    Oxford a little earlier. The following is a copy of Rosee’s handbill
    (see Chambers’s <cite>Book of Days</cite>, vol. i. p. 170):—
  </p>


  <p class="center">THE VERTUE OF THE COFFEE DRINK</p>

  <p class="center"><i>First made and publickly sold in England by Pasqua Rosee.</i></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “The grain or berry called coffee, groweth upon little trees only
      in the deserts of Arabia. It is brought from thence, and drunk
      generally throughout all the Grand Seignour’s dominions. It is a
      simple, innocent thing, composed into a drink, by being dried in an
      oven, and ground to powder, and boiled up with spring water, and
      about half a pint of it to be drunk fasting an hour before, and
      not eating an hour after, and to be taken as hot as possibly can
      be endured; the which will never fetch the skin off the mouth, or
      raise any blisters by reason of that heat.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Turks’ drink at meals and other times is usually water, and
      their diet consists much of fruit; the crudities whereof are very
      much corrected by this drink.
    </p>

    <p>
      The quality of this drink is cold and dry; and though it be drier,
      yet it neither heats, nor inflames more than hot posset. It so
      incloseth the orifice of the stomach, and fortifies the heat
      within, that it is very good to help digestion; and therefore of
      great use to be taken about three or four o’clock afternoon, as
      well as in the morning. It much quickens the spirits, and makes
      the heart lightsome; it is good against sore eyes, and the better
      if you hold your head over it and take in the steam that way. It
      suppresseth fumes exceedingly, and therefore is good against the
      headache, and will very much stop any defluxion of rheums, that
      distil from the head upon the stomach, and so prevent and help
      consumptions and the cough of the lungs.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is excellent to prevent and cure the dropsy, gout, and scurvy.
      It is known by experience to be better than any other drying drink
      for people in years, or children that have any running humours
      upon them, as the king’s evil, etc. It is a most excellent remedy
      against the spleen, hypochondriac winds, and the like. It will
      prevent drowsiness, and make one fit for business, if one have
      occasion to watch, and therefore you are not to drink of it after
      supper, unless you intend to be watchful, for it will hinder sleep
      for three or four hours.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is observed that in Turkey, where this is generally drunk, that
      they are not troubled with the stone, gout, dropsy, or scurvy,
      and that their skins are exceeding clear and white. It is neither
      laxative nor restringent.

    The coffee-houses, thus begun, multiplied rapidly. The new drink, which
    did not intoxicate, became popular; the coffee-houses were places
    where men could sit and talk without getting drunk; it was a cheap
    amusement, and, in a time of great political agitation and excitement,
    the coffee-house became a power of immense influence. For this reason
    the Government became alarmed, and, in 1675, endeavoured to suppress
    the new institution. The attempt was a failure. The coffee-houses were
    already the favourite meeting-places of men of all professions and
    of all opinions. In the graver places where physicians, divines, and
    responsible merchants met, the conversation was serious over coffee and
    tobacco. In other coffee-houses the company were diverted with songs,
    music, and even tumbling.

  <p>
    Some of the coffee-houses offered the attraction of a museum of
    curiosities, probably things brought from the East by sailors.

    I have before me one of the earliest tracts on the subject of
    coffee. It is a doggerel poem dated 1665, called “The Character of a
    Coffee-House.” How is one to know a coffee house? By the signs:—

    The chocolate-house was another place of resort. It was noted for its
    decorations, being not only beautifully painted and gilt, but also
    provided with looking-glasses all round the room. But as yet the people
    were afraid of taking even a cup of chocolate without a dram to fortify
    the stomach. “Bring in,” says the gallant, “two dishes of chocolate
    and a glass of cinnamon water.” And the City ladies, if they invited
    friends to a tea-drinking, finished with cordials to counteract any bad
    effects.

    The use of tobacco had by this time become universal. Sorbière says
    that men spent half their time over tobacco. Even women and children
    smoked pipes; some men took tobacco and pipes to bed with them in case
    of being sleepless. I find in one of Howell’s Letters a dissertation
    on the use of tobacco, which is more instructive than any other
    contemporary document:—
  </p>

  <p>
    “To usher in again old Janus, I send you a parcel of Indian perfume,
    which the Spaniard calls the Holy Herb, in regard of the various
    Virtues it hath; but we call it Tobacco; I will not say it grew under
    the King of Spain’s Window, but I am told it was gathered near his
    Gold-Mines of Potosi (where they report, that in some Places there
    is more of that Ore than Earth), therefore it must needs be precious
    Stuff; if moderately and seasonably taken (as I find you always do)
    ’tis good for many Things; it helps Digestion, taken a-while after
    Meat; a leaf or two being steeped o’er Night in a little White-wine
    is a Vomit that never fails in its Operations; it is a good Companion
    to one that converseth with dead Men; for if one hath been poring
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
    long upon a book, or is toil’d with the Pen, and stupify’d with study,
    it quickeneth him, and dispels those Clouds that usually o’erset the
    Brain. The smoke of it is one of the wholesomest scents that is,
    against all contagious Airs, for it o’er-masters all other smells, as
    King James, they say, found true, when being once a Hunting, a Shower
    of Rain drove him into a Pigsty for Shelter, where he caus’d a Pipeful
    to be taken on purpose; It cannot endure a Spider or a Flea, with such
    like Vermin, and if your Hawk be troubled with any such being blown
    into his feathers, it frees him; it is good to fortify and to preserve
    the sight, the smoke being let in round about the Balls of the Eyes
    once a week, and frees them from all rheums, driving them back by way
    of Repurcussion; being taken backward ’tis excellent good against the
    Cholic, and taken into the Stomach, it will heat and cleanse it; for
    I could instance in a great Lord (my Lord of Sunderland, President
    of York) who told me that he taking it downward into his Stomach, it
    made him cast up an Imposthume, Bag and all, which had been a long
    time engendering out of a Bruise he had received at Foot-ball, and so
    preserv’d his life for many years. Now to descend from the substance
    of the smoke to the ashes, ’tis well known that the medicinal virtues
    thereof are very many; but they are so common, that I will spare the
    inserting of them here; but if one would try a pretty conclusion, how
    much smoke there is in a Pound of Tobacco, the Ashes will tell him; for
    let a pound be exactly weighed, and the ashes kept charily, and weighed
    afterwards, what wants of a Pound Weight in the Ashes cannot be deny’d
    to have been smoke, which evaporated into Air. I have been told that
    Sir Walter Raleigh won a Wager of Queen Elizabeth upon this Nicety.

  <p>
    The Spaniards and Irish take it most in powder or smutchin, and it
    mightily refreshes the Brain, and I believe there’s as much taken this
    way in Ireland, as there is in Pipes in England; one shall commonly
    see the serving-maid upon the washing-block, and the swain upon the
    plough-share, when they are tired with Labour, take out their boxes of
    Smutchin, and draw it into their Nostrils with a Quill, and it will
    beget new spirits in them, with a fresh Vigor to fall to their Work
    again. In Barbary, and other parts of Africk, it is wonderful what a
    small pill of Tobacco will do; for those who used to ride post through
    the sandy Deserts, where they meet not with anything that’s potable or
    edible, sometimes three Dayes together, they use to carry small Balls
    or Pills of Tobacco, which being put under the Tongue, it affords them
    a perpetual Moisture, and takes off the Appetite for some days.”

    <span class="smcap">On</span> the homely subject of washing an excellent little paper may be found
    in Chambers’s <cite>Book of Days</cite>. What were the “things” put out for the
    lavender or laundress? The common people wore neither shirts nor socks
    nor any under-clothing at all. Towels, napkins, table-cloths, sheets,
    pillow-cases, were the things that were washed, in all houses except
    the very poorest; the mediæval inventories of furniture show that
    pillows and cushions were much used in every house. Of personal things
    linen shirts were not anciently worn even by great and rich nobles;
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
    they wore their splendid velvets and silks next to the skin; the poor
    man was dressed in black coarse woollen with, if he were fortunate,
    some kind of cloak: there were no night-shirts. When ladies began to
    use night-dresses they were of costly material which would not wash.
    Anne Boleyn slept in a night-dress of black satin, bound with black
    taffeta and edged with black velvet. Queen Elizabeth slept in velvet
    lined in fur.

    A “Washing Tally” preserved at Haddon Hall, supposed to be of Charles
    the First’s time, enumerates all the different articles then sent to
    the wash. They were ruffles, bandes, cuffes, “handkercher,” caps,
    shirts, half-shirts, boot-hose, tops, socks, sheets, pillow-cases,
    table-cloths, napkins, and towels.
  </p>

  <p>
    Most of these names require no explanation. The band was the white
    collar round the neck, which was either starched to stand up or else it
    lay upon the shoulders. The box that kept them was called a band-box.
    Boot-hose were like “tights” of the present day, drawn up the whole
    length of the leg. The sock, sometimes embroidered, was drawn over
    the hose to the calf of the leg. It was customary when the washing
    was done at home for the women to begin at midnight or very early in
    the morning. Pepys complains of being disturbed in the night by the
    laundresses. The basket in which the linen was thrown was called the
    “buck” or the “buck-basket.”
  </p>

  <p>
    The Puritanic fashions of dress, manners, and speech still continued
    in the City. While the Court party wore their hair long and curled,
    the Puritans cropped theirs close; they drawled in their speech; they
    interlarded their discourse with texts and allusions to Scripture; they
    still, though the power had gone from them, denounced all sorts of
    merry-makings, all sports, all festivals and games as damnable; still
    they continued to find their chief joy and solace at a sermon. There
    was reason for this; for while their thoughts were mainly occupied
    with twisting texts into the support of their favourite doctrines,
    the preacher, who was engaged in exactly the same pursuit, gave them
    materials for the maintenance of their doctrines, or for discussion
    and controversy afterwards. The women, it is said, took down the
    principal points in shorthand, being as much interested and as keen in
    controversy as the men.
  </p>

  <p>
    I do not know any period in which it could not be said that the dress
    of the gallants and courtiers, as well as that of the ladies, was not
    extravagant and costly. Certainly the dress of the gallants in the
    seventeenth century, except for the fifteen years of Puritan austerity,
    was costly and extravagant enough to please any one. It does not
    appear, however, that the extravagance in dress descended to the City
    or to the City madams. In the time of Elizabeth the excessive adornment
    of the latter was the subject of many satirical pens. Under Charles II.
    the sobriety of the men, still more or less under Puritan influence,
    was reflected in the quiet dress of the women. As for the Court ladies,
    Evelyn observes that they paint; Pepys finds patches coming in with
    the Restoration; he also notices, but without admiration, the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span> hair
    frizzed up to the ears; in 1662 he says they began to wear perukes—by
    which I understand some addition to their own hair; next year he
    observes the introduction of the vizard. In July 1663 he witnesses
    the riding of the King, Queen, and Court in Hyde Park. “The King and
    the Queen, who looked in this dress, a white-laced waistcoat and a
    crimson short petticoat, with her hair dressed <i xml:lang="fr">à la négligence</i>,
    mighty pretty, and the King rode hand in hand with her. Here was also
    my Lady Castlemaine [who] rode among the rest of the ladies: but the
    King took, methought, no notice of her.... She looked mighty out of
    humour, and had a yellow plume in her hat, which all took notice of,
    and yet is very handsome.... I followed them up into Whitehall and into
    the Queen’s presence, where all the ladies walked, talking and fiddling
    with their hats and feathers, and changing and trying one another’s by
    one another’s head and laughing.... But above all Mrs. Stewart in this
    dress, with her hat cocked and a red plume, with her sweet eye, little
    Roman nose and excellent taille, is now the greatest beauty I ever saw,
    I think, in my life.”

  <p>
    I do not propose to dwell upon the changes of fashion, because the
    alterations in a sleeve, or in the length of a lady’s waist, would
    carry us too far and would be of little profit. But there was one
    change in fashion which one must not pass over, because it exercised an
    influence upon the whole national character. This was the introduction
    of the peruke, perruque, or wig. Ladies began to wear wigs, presumably,
    as they do now, to conceal the ravages of time, and the falling off
    of the natural hair. Malcolm is of opinion that the wig was a natural
    reaction against the Roundhead rule.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span> For the Roundheads cropped their
    hair and the Cavaliers wore it long in curls. Therefore, he who had a
    scanty supply of curls, or was bald, to escape being taken for one of
    the opposite camp, put on a wig; next he excited envy by the fulness
    and length of his curls; finally all wore wigs, and the fashion set in
    which lasted a hundred years, and, as regards the clergy, for nearly
    two hundred years. A good deal might be said for the use of a wig. It
    was, to begin with, an age when the heads of all the lower classes,
    servants and working people, were always filled with vermin—one learns
    that even so late as a hundred years ago it was almost impossible to
    keep the children of quite respectable people clean in this respect.
    Next, the time and trouble of having the head dressed and the curls
    twisted—for not even a Cavalier could always depend upon a natural
    curl—were saved by sending the wig to the hairdresser. Again, when
    everybody wore a shaven face, the adoption of the wig went far to
    conceal and disguise one’s age. Baldness there was none, nor any grey
    hairs. A man generally had two wigs; a new wig of ordinary make cost
    about three guineas, but one might pay a great deal more for a superior
    wig. “Forty guineas a year,” cries an indignant writer, “for periwigs,
    and but ten to a poor chaplain.” The wigs were at first an imitation
    of a man’s own hair in colour, with some exaggeration in length; and
    although cleanliness was one reason for their introduction, they had to
    be sent to the barbers occasionally in order to be freed from vermin.
    After the Plague, for a long time, nobody would buy a wig for fear of
    infection. The fashion was, of course, carried to ridiculous lengths;
    Lord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
    Foppington, in the <cite>Relapse</cite>, is said to have a periwig down to
    his knees; he also says that a periwig should be to a man like a mask
    to a woman; nothing should be seen but his eyes.” The various kinds of
    wig belong to the eighteenth century, in which they are treated more
    fully.

  <p>The following are a few more scattered notes on fashion:—</p>

  <p>
    Both men and women carried pocket mirrors; the women had these dangling
    from their girdles; the men carried them in their hands or in their
    pockets, and sometimes stuck them in their hats.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was one of the affectations of the time for the gallants to go
    abroad with their faces half covered by their cloaks and their hats
    drawn down. Hence the stage custom of throwing the cloak across from
    the right to the left.
  </p>

  <p>
    The coats of inferior functionaries, such as bailiffs or catchpoles,
    were adorned with pewter buttons.
  </p>

  <p>
    A country gentleman’s dress consisted of Devonshire Kersey suit, coarse
    cloth coat, Dutch felt hat, worsted stockings, and neat leather shoes.
  </p>

  <p>
    All craftsmen wore aprons, but these were different; the blacksmith had
    a leathern apron, the grocer a white apron, the vintner a blue apron,
    and so on. One could formerly recognise a man’s trade by his dress and
    appearance.
  </p>

  <p>
    I find that this century introduced the use of the nightcap, perhaps
    for the sake of quiet, because, with the bawling of the watchman, the
    cry of the chimney-sweep, and the noise of the laundresses, who began
    about midnight, there was almost as much noise at night as by day.
  </p>

  <p>
    If men disfigured themselves with wigs, the women heightened their
    charms, as they believed, by sticking little bits of black taffeta on
    their faces. The fashion began in the Commonwealth, when ladies began
    to cut out stars, circles, and even figures representing a coach and
    four, and stick them upon their cheek, forehead, or chin:—
  </p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">“Her patches are of every cut,</div>
        <div class="i3">For pimples and for scars;</div>
        <div class="i1">Here’s all the wandering planets’ signs,</div>
        <div class="i3">And some of the fixed stars.”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    Like the fashion of the wig, the patch lasted more than a hundred
    years. Indeed, it lasted even into the nineteenth century. And in 1826,
    a lady, speaking of a toilet-table, speaks of the patch-boxes upon it.
    This proves, I take it, that the patch-box still retained its position
    on the table, though the use of it had been abandoned. I have one of
    these patch-boxes; it is of silver, about the same size as a snuff-box,
    but a great deal deeper.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ladies painted as well as patched. They prepared their faces for the
    paint with oil. The page—<cite>The Silent Woman</cite>—says that “my lady kisses
    me with her oil’d face and puts a peruke on my head.” They seem all to
    have worn a peruke. Mrs. Otter, according to her husband, has a peruke
    “like a pound of hemp, made up in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
    shoe threads.” They understood the
    art of making up. “Her teeth were made on the Blackfriars, both her
    eyebrows in the Strand, and her hair in Silver Street.... She takes
    herself asunder when she goes to bed into some twenty boxes; and about
    noon next day is put together again like a great German clock.”
  </p>

  <p>
    In walking with a lady the custom was to take her fan and play with it
    for her. A fine gentleman displayed his fashion and his grace by the
    way he handled and waved the fan.

  <p>
    There was a pretty custom observed by gentlefolk on the 1st of May.
    The maypoles had been restored, but the old dances were well-nigh
    forgotten. The people on this day flocked to Hyde Park; but gentlemen
    escorted their mistresses into the country to bid welcome to the
    spring. There was always a collation in the seventeenth century to mark
    the day or the function, whichever it was.

    Kissing was as common as shaking hands. When a man was introduced to
    a lady he kissed her; men kissed each other. In 1667 Pepys, having
    made a successful speech, was complimented by Mr. Montagu, who kissed
    him. It appears that husbands and lovers were not always pleased at
    this indiscriminate kissing, and there are instances where the ladies
    rebelled against the custom.

    The day of St. Valentine was universally observed. Everybody chose, or
    received by lot, a valentine. On the eve of the 14th of February the
    bachelors and maidens assembled together in equal companies; each wrote
    his or her name on a paper. These were rolled up; the men drew the
    girls’ names, the girls the men’s.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
    This arrangement gave an opening
    for some choice, because everybody had the girl whose name he had drawn
    and the girl who had drawn his name. These matters settled, and every
    man having his Valentine chosen or assigned, it became the duty of
    the man to make a present to the girl and to treat her as if she was
    indeed his mistress. In Pepys’s <cite>Diary</cite>, however, it is apparent that
    married men might have their wives for Valentines and that children
    might have married women. Pepys had his wife for a Valentine two years
    running. In the first he gave her £5, in the second a Turkey stone set
    with diamonds. Poets wrote Valentines. Thus in 1629 J. Howell wrote the
    following pretty lines to his Valentine:—

    The May Day observances, revived with the Restoration, were duly
    honoured. The milkmaids and the sweeps paraded the streets with music.
    The old custom of going out into the fields to gather May dew was kept
    up, though one imagines in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
    formal way only, and not to let good old
    customs decay. On New Year’s Day presents were made by inferiors to
    their patrons, by tenants to the nobles, by the nobles to the King.
  </p>

  <p>
    The observance of Queen Elizabeth’s Day is described in the following
    letter from John Verney to Sir Ralph Verney, November 20, 1679:—
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “Monday being Queen Elizabeth’s coronation day there were vast
      quantities of bonfires about town, but chief of all was at
      Temple Bar, over which gate Queen Elizabeth was deck’t up with a
      Magna Charta and the Protestant religion; there was a devil in a
      pageant and 4 boys in surplices under him, 6 Jesuits, 4 bishops, 4
      archbishops, 2 patriarchs of Jerusalem and Constantinople, several
      cardinals, besides Franciscans, black and grey friars; there was
      also a great crucifix, wax candles, and a bell, and 200 porters
      hired at 2s. a man to carry lights along with the show, which came
      from the Green Yard in great order thro’ Moor (or Cripple) Gate,
      and so along London Wall, then up Houndsditch, and so on again at
      Aldgate, from whence to Temple Bar, where they were disrobed and
      burnt. ’Tis believed there were above 100,000 spectators, and most
      say the King was at Townes’ the goldsmith’s; £10 was an ordinary
      price for a room at Temple Bar” (Walker’s MS. xi. 186).

    People of position still maintained a great many servants. In 1634
    Evelyn’s father was appointed Sheriff of Surrey and Sussex. He had
    116 servants in livery, every one in green satin doublets. Several
    gentlemen and persons of quality waited on him in the same habit.
    He says, however, that thirty or forty was the usual retinue of a
    Sheriff. Pepys, in his modest house in the City, apparently had a cook
    and housemaid, a lady’s maid, and a “girl,” or general assistant. The
    ’prentice in the tradesman’s house was as we have seen a servant, and
    did some of the housework. A footman followed a lady who went out into
    the streets in the daytime;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
    a ’prentice escorted his mistress when she
    went out to a card party in the evening, or when she went to an evening
    lecture at her parish church.

    When a man was rich enough to set up his coach, part of the furniture
    was a pair of running footmen; these ran before the coach. The velocity
    of the machine did not make this exercise a great strain upon their
    activity; they stopped at the next stage and proclaimed the coming
    of the great man. Generally they were dressed in white; they carried
    a cane with a hollow ball at the end, in which was an orange or a
    lemon to refresh themselves with. When the roads became smooth and the
    carriages began to run much faster, the running footmen were gradually
    abolished.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
    They remained, however, till late in the eighteenth
    century. Howell sends a running footman to a friend. He says:—
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “You writ to me lately for a Footman, and I think this Bearer will
      fit you; I know he can run well, for he hath run away twice from
      me, but he knew the way back again. Yet tho’ he had a running head
      as well as running heels (and who will expect a footman to be a
      stay’s man?) I would not part with him were I not to go post to the
      north. There be some things in him that answer for his Waggeries;
      he will come when you call him, go when you bid him, and shut the
      door after him; he is faithful and stout and a lover of his master;
      he is a great enemy to all dogs if they bark at him in his running,
      for I have seen him confront a huge mastiff and knock him down;
      when you go a country journey, or have him with you a hunting, you
      must spirit him with liquor.”

    <span class="smcap">At</span> weddings wheat was scattered on the head of the bride; scarves,
    gloves, and ribbons of the bride’s colours were presented to the
    bridesmen; at the church the company carried rosemary; after the
    ceremony the bride handed the cup around; it contained “sops in wine”
    hallowed, and was called the knitting cup; afterwards was presented
    the bride cake, but not in the church; there was a great feast, as
    sumptuous as the bride’s father could afford; the bride wore her
    hair on this, her last appearance as a maiden, down her back. She
    distributed at her wedding, bride laces. At the better houses an
    epithalamium was pronounced; in the case of rich people there was
    a masque; in all houses, rich or poor, there was music, there was
    bride-ale, and there was feasting. There was also fooling of various
    kinds, with jests not the most seemly, and forms and ceremonies not the
    most refined, which have long since been abandoned. Even in that time
    voices were lifted up against the licence of the wedding sports.
  </p>

  <p>
    Flowers, herbs, and rushes were strewed before the footsteps of the
    bride on her way to church. It was unlucky if the rain fell upon a
    wedding, and equally unlucky if the bride failed to weep during the
    ceremony. The lucky days for weddings were as follows:—

    The funeral customs are described in the following (<cite>Antiq. Rep.</cite> iv.
    585):—
  </p>

  <p>
    “I met nothing more pleasing to me than the funeral ceremonies at the
    interment of a My Lord, which mine host procured me the sight of. The
    relations and friends being assembled in the house of the defunct, the
    minister advanced into the middle of the chamber, where, before the
    company, he made a funeral oration, representing the great actions
    of the deceased, his virtues, his qualities, his titles of nobility,
    and those of the whole family; so that nothing more could be said
    towards consoling every one of the company for the great loss they had
    sustained in this man, and principally the relations, who were seated
    round the dead body, and whom he assured that he was gone to heaven,
    the seat of all sorts of happiness, whereas the world that he had just
    left was replete with misery. It is to be remarked that during this
    oration there stood upon the coffin a large pot of wine, out of which
    every one drank to the health of the deceased, hoping that he might
    surmount the difficulties he had to encounter in his road to Paradise,
    where, by the mercy of God, he was about to enter; on which mercy
    they founded all their hope, without considering their evil life and
    that God is just. This being finished, six men took up the corpse,
    and carried it on their shoulders to the church: it was covered with
    a large cloth, which the four nearest relations held each by a corner
    with one hand, and in the other carried a bough. The other relations
    and friends had in one hand a flambeau, and in the other a bough,
    marching thus through the street, without singing or saying any prayer,
    till they came to the church, where, having placed the body on trestles
    and taken off the cloth from the coffin (which is ordinarily made of
    fine walnut-tree, handsomely worked and ornamented with iron bandages,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
    chased in the manner of a buffet), the minister then ascended his
    pulpit, and, every one being seated round about the coffin, which is
    placed in a kind of parade in the middle of the church, he read a
    portion of Holy Scripture, concerning the resurrection of the dead, and
    afterwards sang some psalms, to which all the company answered. After
    this he descended, having his bough in his hand like the rest of the
    congregation; this he threw on the dead body when it was put into the
    grave, as did all the relations, extinguishing their flambeaux in the
    earth with which the corpse was to be covered. This finished, every one
    retired to his home without farther ceremony.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Poor people seem to have been lowered into the grave either quite naked
    or wrapped in a shroud without any coffin.

  <p class="noindent">
    <span class="smcap">The</span> places of resort in this century, and especially in the reign
    of Charles the Second, reveal the existence of a new class: that of
    the fashionable class, the people who live for amusement. They have
    grown up by degrees; they inhabit a new town lying between the Inns of
    Court and Hyde Park, which they have built for themselves; they have
    made a society composed entirely of themselves, frequenting the same
    coffee-houses and taverns, belonging to the same sets, and following
    the same kind of life. They have invented the fashionable saunter;
    they have made the theatre their own; they have introduced the <i xml:lang="fr">salon</i>
    and the reception. They gamble a great deal; they lounge a great deal;
    they make love a great deal; they drink; they dress extravagantly; they
    practise affectations; they lay bets; they run races; they live, in a
    word, exactly the same careless, useless, mischievous life which their
    successors have continued ever since.
  </p>

  <p>Among the other things which we owe to them is the Park.</p>

  <p>
    The old maps of the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries represent
    the area which is now the Green Park and Hyde Park as green fields;
    these fields formed part of the manors known as Neyte and Hyde, which
    belonged to the Abbey of Westminster until the reign of Henry the
    Eighth, when they fell to the Crown, being exchanged for the Priory
    of Hurley in Berkshire. Henry the Eighth either stocked the fields
    with deer, or found deer there and ran a fence round the fields so
    as to enclose them. During the sixteenth and part of the seventeenth
    centuries Hyde Park was a Royal hunting-ground. In the reign of Charles
    the First it was also a racecourse. In Cromwell’s time it was a place
    for driving and for carriage races; under Charles the Second it became
    a promenade and a drive, just as it is at the present day.
  </p>

  <p>St. James’s Park came into existence later than Hyde Park.</p>

  <p>
    It began with Spring Gardens, named after a spring which here issued
    from the ground, but was not enough to feed the fountain which
    ornamented the gardens. They were not public gardens, though many
    people were admitted; they contained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
    orchards of fruit-trees, lawns
    and bowling greens, a bathing pond, and a butt for archery practice.
    James the First kept some of his menagerie in these gardens. In Charles
    the First’s reign an ordinary was allowed to be kept here; it was six
    shillings a head, and all day long there was tippling under the trees
    with frequent quarrels. Charles was much offended by these unseemly
    broils and shut up the place. An enterprising barber, however, came to
    the rescue of the players, and set up a large establishment between
    St. James’s Street and the Haymarket, where were two bowling greens, a
    tavern, an ordinary, card tables, and rooms for gaming of all kinds.
  </p>

  <p>
    Spring Gardens were opened again during the Civil War, with the old
    customs of drinking; it was, however, provided that the Gardens should
    be closed on public fast days. In 1654 they were closed altogether;
    Evelyn (May 10) has an entry:—
  </p>

  <p>
    “My Lady Gerrard treated us at Mulberry Garden, now the only place
    of refreshment about the towne for persons of the best quality to be
    exceedingly cheated at, Cromwell and his partisans having shut up
    and seized on Spring Gardens, which, till now, had been the usual
    rendezvous for the ladies and gallants at this season.”
  </p>

  <p>
    In 1658 it was open again, for Evelyn “collation’d” there on his way to
    see a coach race in Hyde Park.
  </p>

  <p>
    The best account of the Garden is one quoted by Larwood from <cite class="pr1">A Character
    of England</cite><a id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>:—
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “The inclosure is not disagreeable, for the solemness of the grove,
      the warbling of the birds, and as it opens into the spacious walks
      of St. James’s. But the company walk in it at such a rate as you
      would think all the ladies were so many Atalantas contending with
      their wooers; and there was no appearance that I should prove the
      Hippomenes who would with very much ado keep pace with them. But,
      as fast as they run, they stay there so long as if they wanted not
      time to finish the race; for it is usual here to find some of the
      young company till midnight; and the thickets of the garden seem
      to be contrived to all advantages of gallantry, after they have
      been refreshed with the collation, which is here seldom omitted,
      at a certain <i xml:lang="fr">cabaret</i> in the middle of this paradise, where
      the forbidden fruits are certain trifling tarts, neats-tongues,
      salacious meats, and bad Rhenish (wine); for which the gallants pay
      sauce, as indeed they do at all such houses throughout England;
      for they think it a piece of frugality beneath them to bargain
      or account for what they eat in any place, however unreasonably
      imposed upon. But thus those mean fellows are enriched—beggar and
      insult over the gentlemen. I am assured that this particular host
      has purchased within few years 5000 livres of annual rent, and well
      he may, at the rate these prodigals pay” (J. Larwood, <cite>The Story of
      the London Parks</cite>).
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    A more detailed description shows us a garden laid out in square beds,
    each twenty or thirty paces in length and breadth, and surrounded with
    hedges of red currants, roses, and shrubs; in the beds were growing
    strawberries and vegetables, the borders were lined with flowers, and
    fruit-trees were growing up the walls. Pepys took his wife, his two
    servants, and his boy there on the King’s birthday, 1662.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span></p>

  <p>
    Visitors could help themselves, apparently, for the servants gathered
    pinks from the borders. The building of houses about Charing Cross
    destroyed the rural charm of these gardens; part of them were built
    upon; a small part still remains at the back of the street now called
    Spring Gardens.
  </p>

  <p>
    Evelyn has mentioned the Mulberry Gardens. This place was on the site
    of Buckingham Palace. James the First in 1609, following the example
    of Henry the Fourth of France, endeavoured to establish a silk-growing
    industry. With this object he sent out to the various counties
    mulberry-trees by the hundred thousand. He enclosed four acres of St.
    James’s Park, and planted them with mulberry-trees. In Cromwell’s time
    the Gardens were sold; at the Restoration they returned to the King,
    who threw them open. They became for a time the fashionable resort; by
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
    day the non-decorous took cheese-cakes in their summer houses; at night
    they were the haunt of “gentlemen and ladies that made love together,
    till twelve o’clock at night, the pretty leest.” There were arbours for
    supper parties; there were also dark paths in the “Wilderness.” Dryden
    used to take Mrs. Reeve, an actress of Killigrew’s Company, to the
    Mulberry Gardens. The place was closed about the year 1675.

      ST. JAMES’S PARK
      <div class="subcap">From the Crace Collection in the British Museum.</div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    St. James’s Park began as a marshy piece of ground overflowed by the
    river at high tides, stretching out between St. James’s Hospital and
    Thorney Island. The Hospital, founded by the citizens of London “before
    the time of any man’s memory,” was intended to receive fourteen poor
    sisters, maidens, who were leprous; they were placed in this house
    to live chastely and honestly in divine service. It was endowed with
    land sufficient to maintain these unfortunate women in comfort; they
    possessed as well a brotherhood of six chaplains and two laymen. And
    in 1290 Edward the First gave them a fair, to be held for seven days,
    beginning on St. James’s Eve, July 24.
  </p>

  <p>
    The house is said to be mentioned in an MS. in the Cottonian Library
    of the year 1100; it was, therefore, certainly the oldest hospital
    belonging to London.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was rebuilt in the reign of Henry the Third. In 1450, after there
    had been many disputes with the Abbey of Westminster over alleged
    rights of visit, Henry the Sixth placed the house in the perpetual
    custody of Eton College. Henry the Eighth acquired it by purchase
    in 1537 and, according to Stow, compounded with the inmates. It has
    been stated that only one sister received a pension. I think the two
    statements may be reconciled. Thus the dread of leprosy had by this
    time vanished. There were very few lepers left in the country, if any.
    At the hospital of Sherburn, Durham, which originally contained five
    <em>convents</em> of lepers, of both sexes, <i xml:lang="la">i.e.</i> sixty-five persons, in 1593
    the house contained only men; “sick, or whole, Lepers, or wayfaring.”
    Surtees, <cite>History of Durham</cite>, says that it would have been difficult,
    long before, to find a single leper in the country.
  </p>

  <p>
    What, then, happened at St. James’s? One of two things. Either the
    sisters were reduced to one, and only one, who would be considered a
    leper; or that the house, like so many others, had been allowed to
    depart from its foundation, and had admitted as sisters, women who were
    not lepers at all.
  </p>

  <p>
    However, Henry enclosed the ground belonging to the hospital, stocked
    it with deer, and turned it into a pleasure garden for himself.
  </p>

  <p>
    James the First kept his menagerie here. Henry, Prince of Wales, ran at
    the ring and practised horsemanship here.
  </p>

  <p>
    During the Commonwealth the Park was not sold, but preserved, though
    the deer seem to have run away. A certain number of people were
    privileged to walk in the Park.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then Charles came back, and began at once to improve the Park. He
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
    constructed the canal, or ornamental water; he laid out the Mall; he
    made a rising ground beside Rosamond’s pond; he erected beautiful
    avenues of trees. More than this, he opened the Park and gave a new
    place of resort, much finer than it had ever before enjoyed, to the
    fashionable world of London. The literature of the period is full of
    the Park and its frequenters.
  </p>

  <p>
    New Spring Gardens at Vauxhall were formed in imitation of the old,
    and were named after them. Evelyn mentions the place in 1661, Pepys
    1665; he calls it Foxhall. He went there in June and in July; on the
    latter day he did not find a single guest there. There were, however,
    plenty of guests at other times. Pepys observes how the young fellows
    take hold of every woman in the place. He heard the nightingale sing;
    he heard the fiddles, and the harp, and the Jew’s trump; he heard the
    talk of the young men—“Lord, their mad talk did make my heart ake.” He
    had cheese-cakes, syllabubs, and wine in the gardens; and, as at the
    theatre, he and his wife were not ashamed to be seen when the company
    was notoriously profligate, and the women notoriously devoid of virtue.
  </p>

  <p>
    Gray’s Inn Gardens was another place of resort, probably for lawyers
    and their ladies. For the people of Holborn and Fleet Street there
    were the Lamb’s Conduit Fields. These spacious fields extended from
    Tottenham Court Road to Gray’s Inn Road, and as far to the north as
    what is now the Euston Road. There were no houses upon them in the
    seventeenth century except Lamb’s Conduit, erected in 1577. For the
    City there were the Moor fields, then enclosed, planted with trees
    and surrounded by shops; there were the Hoxton Fields, the Spa Fields
    of Clerkenwell, and the White Conduit Fields. It was the especial
    happiness of London at this time that from any part of the City the
    open country was accessible within a quarter of an hour. All around
    these fields sprang up places of amusement, pleasure gardens, and
    taverns, which I have described fully in considering the eighteenth
    century.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the City itself the favourite resorts were, for the young men, the
    galleries of the Royal Exchange, which were occupied by shops for the
    sale of gloves, ribbons, laces, fans, scent, and such things. The
    shops were served by girls, whose pretty faces and ready tongues were
    the chief attraction for the young fellows, who went there to flirt
    rather than to buy. Some of the younger citizens also found the Piazza
    of Covent Garden a convenient place to lounge and saunter. There were
    attractions in the Piazzas, too, of the other sex. There was also the
    interior of St. Paul’s Cathedral.
  </p>

  <p>
    The coffee-houses quickly became a place of resort for the graver
    citizen in the evening. He would not go to the theatre, where the
    exhibition of actresses still offended his sense of propriety; he
    had formerly gone to the tavern, but a dish of coffee was far more
    wholesome than a bowl of punch, and discourse among men who were sober
    was much more instructive than that of men who were drunk.
  </p>

  <p>
    Of course, there were still left plenty of those who stuck to the
    tavern and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
    despised these new inventions of tea and coffee. Indeed,
    for business purposes the tavern continued to be used. Transactions
    of all kinds were conducted in a private room at a tavern, over a
    bottle. If a customer came up to London, the shopkeeper took him to the
    tavern when, in the Rose or the Sun, they performed their business.
    The coffee-house never took the place of the tavern in that respect.
    The most extraordinary secrecy was expected and maintained on either
    side over the smallest matter of trade. The number of taverns was then
    very great. They literally lined the two most important arteries, that
    from St. George’s, Southwark, to Bishopsgate Street Without, and that
    between the Royal Exchange and the Strand.

    I have before me a pamphlet in doggerel verse of the year 1671 called

  </p>

  <p>The following is the dedication which enumerates the favourite wines:—</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    The searchers after claret spend two days visiting the taverns and find
    none. I suppose that the war with France had caused a stoppage of the
    supply. In the same way, during the long war with France, 1793–1815,
    the people forgot their old taste for claret; when they drank it at
    all, it was heavy stuff. They visit eighty-eight taverns between
    Whitechapel and Temple Bar and at Westminster, and this without going
    out of the main streets. Many of these taverns are still remembered by
    the tokens which they issued for copper money. Most of these taverns
    were not hostels, and did not provide lodgings; they were taverns and
    nothing more; they were frequented, as has been said, by tradesmen
    during the day; in the evening there were societies, clubs, and trades,
    which held their meetings in the taverns. For instance, in the Mitre,
    Cheapside, afterwards called the Goose and Gridiron, the Society of
    Musicians met and gave their concerts. At the Cock and the Devil of
    Fleet Street the lawyers thronged.

  <p class="noindent">
    <span class="smcap">On</span> December 8, 1660, a great change was effected at the theatre. For
    the first time, to the exasperation of the Puritans, a woman’s part
    was taken by a woman. The place was the theatre of Vere Street. The
    part first performed was that of Desdemona. The prologue written “to
    introduce the first woman that came to act on the stage” was as follows
    (Leigh Hunt, <cite>The Town</cite>):—
  </p>

  <div class="center-container">

        <div class="i0">“I came unknown to any of the rest</div>

        <div class="i1">Abhor all sorts of looseness, and yet play:</div>
        <div class="i1">Play on the stage—where all eyes are upon her:</div>

        <div class="i1">Barebones himself may come to see a play.”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>And the epilogue, much shorter, was as follows:—</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">“And how do you like her? Come, what is’t ye drive at?</div>
        <div class="i1">She’s the same thing in public as in private,</div>
        <div class="i1">As far from being what you call a whore</div>
        <div class="i1">As Desdemona injured by the Moor:</div>
        <div class="i1">Then he that censures her in such a case</div>
        <div class="i1">Hath a soul blacker than Othello’s face.</div>
        <div class="i1">But, ladies, what think you? for it you tax</div>
        <div class="i1">Her freedom with dishonour to your sex,</div>
        <div class="i1">She means to act no more, and this shall be</div>
        <div class="i1">No other play, but her own tragedy.</div>
        <div class="i1">She will submit to none but your commands,</div>
        <div class="i1">And take commission only from your hands.”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    This change altered the whole character of the theatre. At the
    beginning it lowered the tone of the stage, which was already bad
    enough. When the spectators became accustomed to the appearance of
    women on the stage, it began perhaps to have a refining influence, but
    certainly not at first.
  </p>

  <p>
    In Wycherley’s <cite>Country Wife</cite>, Pinchwife takes his wife to the
    “eighteen-penny place” so that she shall not be seen. This place was
    the tier called the upper boxes. Ladies sometimes went into the Pit,
    but not alone. In the same play Alithea says to her lover, “I will
    not go if you intend to leave me alone in the Pit as you used to do.”
    Ladies, however, for the most part, went into the first tier or dress
    circle, where they received visits from their friends. Lord Foppington
    says, “After dinner I go to the play, where I amuse myself till nine
    o’clock with looking upon the company, and usually dispose of an hour
    more in leading them out.”
  </p>

  <p>
    The tickets were, to the boxes, 4s.; to the Pit, half-a-crown; to the
    upper boxes, 1s. 6d.; and to the gallery, 1s. There were only two
    theatres, the King’s and the Duke of York’s; the seats were simple
    benches without backs.
  </p>

  <p>
    Pepys, a great lover of the stage, commends the improvement of the
    theatre since the Restoration:—
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “The stage is now by his pains a thousand times better and more
      glorious than ever heretofore. Now, wax-candles, and many of
      them; then, not above 3 lbs. of tallow: now, all things civil, no
      rudeness anywhere; then, as in a bear-garden: then, two or three
      fiddlers; now, nine or ten of the best: then, nothing but rushes
      upon the ground, and everything else mean; and now, all otherwise:
      then, the Queen seldom, and King never would come; now, not the
      King only for state, but all civil people do think they may come
      as well as any. He tells me that he hath gone several times, eight
      or ten times, he tells me, hence to Rome, to hear good musique;
      so much he loves it, though he never did sing or play a note.
      That he hath ever endeavoured in the late King’s time, and in
      this, to introduce good musique, but he never could do it, there
      never having been any musique here better than ballads. Nay, says,
      ‘Hermitt poore’ and ‘Chevy Chese’ was all the musique we had; and
      yet no ordinary fiddlers get so much money as ours do here, which
      speaks our rudenesse still” (Pepys, vol. vi. pp. 171, 172).

    Bankside had long since ceased to be the chosen seat of the drama. The
    Globe, after being burned down and rebuilt, was finally pulled down in
    1644; the Rose, the Swan, and the Bear Garden had met the same fate;
    the Fortune Theatre was destroyed by soldiers in 1549; the Curtain
    had become, before it was pulled down, a place for prize fights;
    Blackfriars Theatre, after standing empty for some years, in accordance
    with the law, was pulled down in 1655.

    In 1642 the Parliament commanded the cessation of plays on the ground
    “that public sports do not well agree with public calamities, nor
    public stage plays with the seasons of humiliation.” So the houses were
    closed. Then, as always happened, the law was timidly and tentatively
    broken; the theatres began again. In 1647,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span> however, a second
    ordinance appeared calling upon the magistrates to enter houses where
    performances were going on and to arrest the performers. This ordinance
    proving of more effect, a third and more stringent law was passed
    denouncing stage plays, interludes, and common plays as the occasion
    of many and sundry great vices and disorders, tending to the high
    provocation of God’s wrath and displeasure, ordered the destruction
    of all galleries, seats, and stages of the theatre. This settled the
    question for the time. Most of the actors went off to fight for the
    King; a few remained and gave private performances at the residences
    of noblemen. In 1658 Davenant opened the old Cockpit Theatre in Drury
    Lane for performances of declamation and music without being molested.
    Probably he ascertained beforehand what the Protector would do. On the
    Restoration a bookseller of dramatic propensities took possession of
    the Cockpit, where he played with his two apprentices, Betterton and
    Kynaston. Killigrew and Davenant obtained patents for opening theatres,
    Killigrew’s company to be called the King’s servants, Davenant’s to be
    called the Duke of York’s servants. Davenant associated with himself
    the dramatic booksellers, and after a season at the Phœnix went to
    the new theatre in Lincoln’s Inn Fields, and from there to the larger
    theatre in Dorset Garden, Fleet Street, a place more commodious because
    it was on the river, the great highway of London. Killigrew began at
    the Red Bull in St. John’s Street, going from that place, which seems
    to have been out of the way, to Gibbon’s Tennis Court in Clare Market.
    He then proceeded to build a new theatre in Drury Lane, not far from
    the Phœnix. The new theatre opened with Beaumont and Fletcher’s comedy
    of the <cite>Humourous Lieutenant</cite> on April 8, 1663. Ten of the company
    were in the Royal household, and had allowances of scarlet cloth and
    lace for liveries; did they wear the livery on the stage? It was here
    that Charles fell in love with Nell Gwynne; she was playing Valeria in
    Dryden’s <cite>Tyrannic Love</cite>. She died on the stage and then jumped up and
    spoke the epilogue:—
  </p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">“O poet, damned dull poet! Who could prove</div>
        <div class="i1">So senseless to make Nelly die for love?</div>
        <div class="i1">Nay, what! yet worse, to kill me in the prime</div>
        <div class="i1">Of Easter time, in tart and cheese-cake time!”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    Here Pepys saw her, was presented to her, and kissed her, “and a mighty
    pretty soul she is.” And again he mentions how he saw her in a part
    called Florimell, “a comical part done by Nell that I never can hope to
    see the like done again by man or woman.”
  </p>

  <p>
    It is sometimes stated that the theatres of the time were still without
    a roof. This appears to be incorrect. Pepys mentions the inconvenience
    of rain. “To the King’s house and saw the <cite>Silent Woman</cite>. Before the
    play was done it fell such a storm of hail that we in the pit were fain
    to rise and all the house in disorder.” A few years later, however, he
    notes (May 1, 1668) another visit to the same theatre,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span> where he saw
    the <cite>Surprizall</cite>, and mentions “a disorder in the pit by its raining
    in from the cupola at top, it being a very foul day.” There was,
    therefore, some kind of dome or cupola open at the side.
  </p>

  <p>
    The time of commencing the performance was three, so that the theatre,
    at all events for the first part of Charles’s reign, was an afternoon
    amusement. The doors were thrown open soon after noon. Pepys, on one
    occasion, went to the theatre a little after noon; the doors were not
    then open, but they were thrown open shortly afterwards. On entering
    the Pit he found many people there already, having got in by private
    ways. As he had had no dinner he found a boy to keep his seat, and
    went outside to get some dinner at the Rose Tavern (Wills’s, Russell
    Street).
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span></p>

  <p>
    The play was constantly changed, and the popularity of the rival houses
    continually varied. On one occasion, on arriving at Drury Lane at
    three, the hour for beginning, Pepys found not one single person in
    the Pit. However, some came late, and there was a performance after
    all. The new fashion of having women instead of boys for the female
    parts was so popular, that plays acted by women alone were actually
    presented. One of the plays then performed, Killigrew’s
    <cite>Parsons Wedding</cite>, is described as “obscene and loose,” for which reason it was
    thought fittest for women to play.
  </p>

  <p>
    The wearing of masks at the theatre, which was common among ladies,
    was due to the disgraceful licence of the dramatist. One would think,
    however, that if ladies disliked the grossness, they might stay away;
    perhaps it was rather due partly to the desire of not attracting
    public attention, partly to the charm of the mysterious. As for women
    disliking the coarseness of the play, we may simply remember that
    though women are in every age better than men in that respect, they are
    not always very much better. Like the clergy, the best we can expect of
    them is that they should be a little better than the men.
  </p>

  <p>
    The seventeenth century witnessed the splendour and the death of the
    masque. For fifty years, if one sought for fine stage scenery, splendid
    dresses, curious stage effects, it was not at the theatre that it was
    to be found, but at the masque.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was a very costly form of entertainment. Private persons could not
    attempt it. No manager of a theatre could attempt it, because the
    fullest house could not pay for producing it. Only great noblemen, rich
    bodies, and the Court could present a masque. There was orchestral
    music of the finest; there were songs, madrigals, choruses; there were
    long speeches; there was dancing, both singly and in groups; there
    were most costly dresses, and there were transformation scenes managed
    with a dexterity worthy of a modern theatre. It is remarkable that the
    theatre never tried to vie with the masque in scenery or dresses or
    music. Ben Jonson was the principal writer of the libretti; Henry Lawn
    was the musician; Gills the inventor of the dances; Inigo Jones the
    machinist and scene painter.
  </p>

  <p>
    James the First and his Queen delighted in the masque. So did Charles
    and Henrietta; the Civil War put a stop to this beautiful and courtly
    entertainment; after the Restoration, when an attempt was made to
    revive it, the taste for it had gone; it had played its part and was
    dead.
  </p>

  <p>Let me present, greatly abbreviated, one of Ben Jonson’s masques:—</p>

  <p>
    The masque of <cite>Neptune’s Triumph for the Return of Albion</cite> is a
    favourable specimen of the scenic effects of the masque. It was played
    on Twelfth Night, 1624.
  </p>

  <p>
    The scene at first showed nothing but two pillars with inscriptions;
    on the one NEP. RED., and on the other SEC. JOV. The masque opens with
    a long and tedious dialogue between a cook and a poet; in the course
    of it the latter explains<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
    the purpose of the masque, which is to
    celebrate the safe return of the Prince from Spain:—
  </p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">“The mighty Neptune, mighty in his styles,</div>
        <div class="i1">And large command of waters, and of isles;</div>
        <div class="i1">Not as the ‘lord and sovereign of the seas,’</div>
        <div class="i1">But ‘chief in the art of riding’ late did please,</div>
        <div class="i1">To send his Albion forth, the most his own,</div>
        <div class="i1">Upon discovery, to themselves best known,</div>
        <div class="i1">Through Celtiberia; and, to assist his course,</div>
        <div class="i1">Gave him his powerful Manager of Horse,</div>
        <div class="i1">With divine Proteus, father of disguise,</div>
        <div class="i1">To wait upon them with his counsels wise,</div>
        <div class="i1">In all extremes. His great commands being done,</div>
        <div class="i1">And he desirous to review his son,</div>
        <div class="i1">He doth dispatch a floating isle, from hence,</div>
        <div class="i1">Unto the Hesperian shores, to waft him thence.</div>
        <div class="i1">Where, what the arts were used to make him stay</div>
        <div class="i1">And how the Syrens woo’d him by the way,</div>
        <div class="i1">What monsters he encountered on the coast,</div>
        <div class="i1">How near our general joy was to be lost,</div>
        <div class="i1">Is not our subject now; though all these make</div>
        <div class="i1">The present gladness greater, for their sake.</div>
        <div class="i1">But what the triumphs are, the feast, the sport,</div>
        <div class="i1">And proud solemnities of Neptune’s court,</div>
        <div class="i1">Now he is safe, and Fame’s not heard in vain,</div>
        <div class="i1">But we behold our happy pledge again.”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    The ground thus cleared, the cook brings in persons representing the
    various ingredients of an Olla Podrida. This was intended for the comic
    part. Then a comic anti-masque is danced by these mummers. After this
    the scene opens, and discloses the Island of Delos. The masquers are
    sitting in their “sieges.” Then the heavens open and disclose Apollo,
    Mercury, the Muses, and the Goddess Harmony. Below, Proteus is sitting.
    Apollo sings:—
  </p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">“Look forth, the shepherd of the seas,</div>
        <div class="i1">And of the ports that keep’st the keys,</div>
        <div class="i5">And to your Neptune tell,</div>
        <div class="i1">His Albion, prince of all his isles,</div>
        <div class="i1">For whom the sea and land so smiles,</div>
        <div class="i5">Is home returned well.”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">
    The island moves forward and joins the mainland. There is a grand
    chorus of Proteus and the others while the masquers land. While they
    prepare for their entry the chorus sings another verse:—
  </p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
     <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">“Spring all the Graces of the age,</div>
        <div class="i3">And all the Loves of time;</div>
        <div class="i1">Bring all the pleasures of the stage,</div>
        <div class="i3">And relishes of rhyme;</div>
        <div class="i1">And all the softnesses of courts,</div>
        <div class="i3">The looks, the laughters, and the sports;</div>
        <div class="i1">And mingle all their sweets and salts,</div>
        <div class="i3">That none may say, the Triumph halts.”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    Then the masquers “danced their entry.” The dance was performed by the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
    courtiers and the Queen’s ladies. It was a dance invented for the
    occasion, with stately figures, arranged groups, and active “capers.”
    Then the scene was changed and disclosed a maritime palace, the home of
    Oceanus, “with loud music.” “And the other above is no more seen.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “Then follows the main dance, after which the second prospect of the
    sea is shown, to the former music.”
  </p>

  <p>Then Proteus and the others advance to the ladies with another song:—</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">“Come noble nymphs, and do not hide</div>
        <div class="i1">The joys for which you so provide,</div>
        <div class="i1">If not to mingle with the men,</div>
        <div class="i1">What do you hear? go home agen.</div>
        <div class="i5">Your dressings do confess,</div>
        <div class="i1">By what we see so curious parts</div>
        <div class="i1">Of Pallas and Arachne’s arts,</div>
        <div class="i5">That you could mean no less.</div>
        <div class="i1">Why do you wear the silk-worm’s toils,</div>
        <div class="i1">Or glory in the shell-fish spoils,</div>
        <div class="i1">Or strive to shew the grains of ore,</div>
        <div class="i1">That you have gathered on the shore,</div>
        <div class="i5">Whereof to make a stock</div>
        <div class="i1">To graft the greener emerald on,</div>
        <div class="i1">Or any better-water’s stone?</div>
        <div class="i5">Or ruby of the rock?</div>
        <div class="i1">Why do you smell of amber-grise,</div>
        <div class="i1">Of which was formed Neptune’s niece,</div>
        <div class="i1">The Queen of Love; unless you can,</div>
        <div class="i1">Like Sea-born Venus, love a man?</div>
        <div class="i5">Try, put yourselves unto’t,</div>
        <div class="i1">Your looks, your smiles, and thoughts that meet,</div>
        <div class="i1">Ambrosian hands, and silver feet.</div>
        <div class="i5">Do promise you will do’t.”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    The revels follow, which ended, the fleet is discovered, while the
    three cornets play.
  </p>

  <p>
    After a little more foolish talk between the cook and the poet, the
    sailors of the fleet come in and dance, and the whole is concluded with
    a song by ten voices accompanied by the “Whole music, five lutes, three
    cornets”:—
  </p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">“Although we wish the triumph still might last</div>

      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

    <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span></p>
  <p>
    It is sometimes stated that music was killed by the Puritans. If Pepys
    is to be considered as an average London citizen in this respect, their
    music was very far from being killed by the Puritans. We find him, his
    household and his friends, all singing, playing, taking a part; we find
    parties on the river singing part songs as they glided down the stream;
    we hear of the singing in church; at Court the evenings were always
    provided with singing boys; at the theatre songs were plentifully
    scattered about the plays. The Elizabethan custom of music at dinner
    had apparently vanished, yet the power of playing some instrument was
    far more general than it was later. As soon as possible after the
    Restoration the choral service was re-established in the cathedrals and
    the Royal chapels. Cooke, Lawn, Rogers, Wilson, and other composers
    were engaged in forming and teaching the choirs; new anthems were
    composed by Pelham Humphrey or Humfrey, Michael Wise, John Blow, and
    Henry Purcell. The last of these, one of the greatest of English
    composers, was born in 1658 and died in 1695.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was common for people of rank to attend the service of the Chapel
    Royal at Whitehall or that of St. Paul’s Cathedral. At Oxford an
    association was formed, consisting of the leading scholars and
    professors of the University, for the purpose of promoting the study
    and practice of music, vocal and instrumental. It is true that in the
    eighteenth century music seems to have deserted the English household;
    perhaps in the seventeenth it lingered only among the better sort, and
    had already been killed in the circles affected by the sour Puritanism
    of the time.
  </p>

  <p>
    The condition and advancement of painting in the century may be briefly
    considered. The soil was prepared for the development of the fine arts
    by the learning, scholarship, and travel of the English nobles and
    scholars. About the year 1615 the Earl of Arundel began to collect
    pictures, statues, vases, and gems. Prince Henry began a collection
    which at his death passed to his brother Charles. On his accession
    Charles began to increase the Royal collections begun by Henry the
    Eighth, and continued slowly by his successors. Charles bought the
    whole of the cabinet of the Duke of Milan for £18,000. The cartoons of
    Raffaelle were acquired in Flanders by the agency of Rubens. Whitehall
    Palace contained four hundred and sixty pictures, of which twenty-eight
    were by Titian, eleven by Correggio, sixteen by Julio Romano, nine
    by Raffaelle, four by Guido, and seven by Parmigiano. Vandyke, the
    greatest among the pupils of Rubens, came over to this country and
    remained here for life. In 1630 Rubens himself came over, not as a
    painter but as an ambassador. However, he consented to paint the
    ceiling of the Banqueting Hall at Whitehall. Charles planned an Academy
    of Arts, but, like everything else, it had to be set aside.
  </p>

  <p>
    Among lesser painters of the century were William Dobson, John Hoskins,
    Samuel Cooper, John Peiletot, and Geuteleschi, all of whom lived and
    painted in London.

    Lely of course belongs to the first Restoration period. So also do
    Hayls, Michael Wright, Henry Anderton, the two Vandeveldes, and many

    and the first quarter of the eighteenth century.

    The greatest invention of the century was, without doubt, the
    newspaper. As far as this country is concerned, setting aside the
    apocryphal history of the <cite>English Mercury</cite>, its first newspaper was
    started in London by Nathaniel Butter, with whom were associated
    Nicholas Bonner, Thomas Archer, Nathaniel Newberry, William Sheppard,
    Bartholomew Dounes, and Edward Allor. The sheet was called the <cite>Weekly
    News</cite>, and it is believed to have begun on May 23, 1622. In the same
    year the <cite>London Weekly Courant</cite> also began. Twenty years later the
    <cite>Mercurius Clericus</cite> (1641) was started in the interests of the clergy;
    the <cite>Mercurius Britannicus</cite> (1642), the <cite>Mercurius Civicus</cite> (1643),
    the <cite>Mercurius Politicus</cite>, a Parliamentary paper, and <cite>Mercurius
    Pragmaticus</cite>, a Royalist paper.
  </p>

  <p>
    About the year 1663 the <cite>Kingdom’s Intelligence</cite> was started, and this
    was incorporated with the <cite>London Gazette</cite> when that was founded in
    1665.
  </p>

    Of course it was not long before the power of the Press was discovered.
    The Government began to subsidise the papers; private persons began to
    pay for notices in them; and trade advertisements began to appear. All
    these papers were weekly. In 1695, however, the <cite>Post Boy</cite> appeared—the
    first daily paper.

    The prohibition of games on Sunday by the Puritans led to the abolition
    of the working-class’s amusements altogether, and was therefore
    answerable for much of that hideous brutality which possessed that
    class during the latter part of the eighteenth century. They were not
    to wrestle, shoot, play at bowls, ring bells, hold masques, wakes, play
    games of any kind, dance, or exercise any other pastime on Sunday. Now,
    as Sunday was the only day when the working people could play games or
    have any recreation, this prohibition destroyed the knowledge of these
    games, the old delight in them, the desire for them, the skill in them.
    After eighteen years of Puritan rule a new type of working man grew up,
    one who knew no games and could practise none; a duller creature, heavy
    witted, slow of sight, and clumsy of hand; one who would yield to the
    temptation of drink without resistance; one who was capable of sinking
    lower and lower still. This is one of the many blessings which have
    been bestowed upon London by the Puritans.

    For winter amusements the better class had a variety of games, such
    as “cards, tables, dice, shovelboard, chess, the philosophers game,
    small trunks, shuttlecock, billiards, music, masks, singing, dancing,
    all games, frolicks, jests, riddles, catches,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>purposes, questions
    and commands, merry tales of knights errant, queens, lovers, lords,

    The shows and performances at the fairs were extremely popular. There
    were puppet shows, at which scriptural pieces were represented, or the
    Patient Grizzle, or the Lady Godiva; there were tight-rope dancers;
    there were performing dogs or monkeys; there were strong men and
    cunning men; jugglers, and conjurers.
  </p>

  <p>
    Athletic sports were in vogue. Many of the young nobles were expert
    swimmers; others, among whom was the Duke of Monmouth, were fast
    runners, so that foot-races were a favourite amusement. Two of them
    once ran down a buck. Tennis was a favourite game, as was also
    pall-mall; skating, when there was ice, was extensively practised;
    bowl-racing and horse-racing were common. Bowls continued as a game
    which never goes wholly out of fashion. Baiting of the bull and the
    bear were resumed after the Restoration, but the lust for this brutal
    sport seems to have gone out.
  </p>

  <p>
    The evening amusements of James the First, which seem stupid and coarse
    enough, may be perhaps regarded as the natural swing of the pendulum
    after a day spent in the maintenance of the Royal dignity by a king in
    whom there was naturally very little of dignity. The passage also shows
    the kind of amusement which rich men who could afford to keep buffoons
    were pleased to adopt:—
  </p>

  <p>
    “The Monarch, it is said, would leave his dining or supping room to
    witness the pastimes and fooleries performed by Sir Edward Zouch, Sir
    George Goring, and Sir John <i xml:lang="la">Finit</i>. The first sung indecent songs
    and related tales of the same description, the former of which were
    written by <i xml:lang="la">Finit</i>, who procured fiddlers as an accompanyment to Zouch;
    and Goring was master of the game for fooleries, sometimes presenting
    David Droman and Archee Armstrong, the King’s fool, on the back of the
    other fools, to tilt one at another, till they fell together by the
    ears; sometimes antick dances; but Sir John Millisent, who was never
    known before, was commended for notable fooling, and so he was the best
    extempore fool of them all.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Chamberlayn’s <cite>Present State of England</cite> presents the most complete
    picture of the sports of this century:—
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
      “For variety of Devertisements, Sports and Recreations, no Nation
      doth excel the English.
    </p>

    <p>
      The King hath abroad his Forests, Chases, and Parks, full of
      variety of Game; for Hunting Red and Fallow Deer, Foxes, Otters;
      Hawking, his Paddock-Courses, Horse-Races, etc., and at home,
      Tennis, Pelmel, Billiard, Comedies, Opera, Mascarades, Balls,
      Ballets, etc. The Nobility and Gentry have their Parks, Warrens,
      Decoys, Paddock-Courses, Horse-Races, Hunting, Coursing, Fishing,
      Fowling, Hawking, Setting-Dogs, Tumblers, Lurchers, Duck-hunting,
      Cock-fighting, Guns for Birding, Low-Bells, Bat-Fowling, Angling,
      Nets, Tennis, Bowling, Billiards, Tables, Chess, Draughts, Cards,
      Dice, Catches, Questions, Purposes, Stage-Plays, Masks, Balls,
      Dancing, Singing, all sorts of Musical Instruments, etc. The
      citizen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
      and peasants have Hand-Ball, Foot-Ball, Skittles, or
      Nine Pins, Shovel-Board, Stow-Ball, Goffe, Trol Madams, Cudgels,
      Bear-baiting, Bull-baiting, Shuttlecock, Bowling, Quoits, Leaping,
      Wrestling, Pitching the Bar, and Ringing of Bells, a Recreation
      used in no other Country of the World.
    </p>

    <p>
      Amongst these, Cock-fighting seems to all Foreigners too childish
      and unsuitable for the Gentry, and for the Common People
      Bull-baiting and Bear-baiting seem too cruel; and for the Citizens,
      Foot-Ball, and Throwing at Cocks, very uncivil, rude, and barbarous
      within the City.”
    </p>

    In the Directory of London, 1761, there are fifteen streets, lanes,
    and alleys, which are named after the game of bowls. This simple fact
    proves the popularity of the bowling green. These places were licensed
    by James the First. They were allowed to have tennis courts, rooms
    for cards and dice, and such diversions besides bowling greens. They
    were all in the suburbs; there had formerly, however, been a bowling
    green in Thames Street. Twenty-four were allotted to the suburbs of
    London and Westminster; four to Southwark; one to St. Katherine’s
    by the Tower; two to Lambeth; one to Shoreditch; and one to every
    town, village, or hamlet within two miles of London or Westminster.
    In Charles’s reign a barber set up a place provided with two bowling
    greens in Piccadilly, between the Haymarket and St. James Street;
    nothing is said about any licence being required for this venture.
  </p>

  <p>
    Fencing schools were much frequented. The terms used in fencing, which
    are enumerated by Ben Jonson, were all Italian. The masters granted
    degrees to their disciples, <em>Master</em>, <em>Provost</em>, <em>Scholar</em>. These
    schools became haunts of vice, and attempts were made to suppress them,
    but without success.
  </p>

  <p>
    Duke Cosmo says that the fencing masters, in order to gain reputation,
    give a general challenge, offering twenty or thirty jacobuses or more
    to any one who has a mind to fight with them.
  </p>

  <p>
    Josevin de Rochefort, whose travels in England were published in 1672,
    gives a long account of a fencing match:—
  </p>

  <p>
    “We went to see the Bergiardin, which is a great amphitheatre, where
    combats are fought between all sorts of animals, and sometimes men, as
    we once saw. Commonly, when any fencing masters are desirous of shewing
    their courage and their great skill, they issue mutual challenges, and
    before they engage, parade the town with drums and trumpets sounding,
    to inform the public there is a challenge between two brave masters of
    the science of defence, and that the battle will be fought on such a
    day. We went to see this combat, which was performed on a stage in the
    middle of this amphitheatre, where, on the flourishes of trumpets and
    the beat of drums, the combatants entered, stripped to their shirts.
    On a signal from the drum, they drew their swords, and immediately
    began the fight, skirmishing a long time without any wounds. They were
    both very skilful and courageous. The tallest had the advantage over
    the least: for, according to the English fashion of fencing, they
    endeavoured rather to cut than push in the French manner, so that by
    his height he had the advantage of being able to strike his antagonist
    on the head, against which the little one was on his guard. He had in
    his turn an advantage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
    over the great one, in being able to give him
    the jarnac stroke, by cutting him on his right ham, which he left in
    a manner quite unguarded. So that, all things considered, they were
    equally matched. Nevertheless, the tall one struck his antagonist on
    the wrist, which he almost cut off: but this did not prevent him from
    continuing the fight, after he had been dressed, and taken a glass of
    wine or two to give him courage, when he took ample vengeance for his
    wound: for a little afterwards, making a feint at the ham, the tall
    man, stooping in order to parry it, laid his whole head open, when the
    little one gave him a stroke, which took off a slice of his head, and
    almost all of his ear. For my part I think there is an inhumanity,
    a barbarity and cruelty, in permitting men to kill each other for
    diversion. The surgeons immediately dressed them, and bound up their
    wounds: which being done, they resumed the combat, and both being
    sensible of their respective disadvantages, they therefore were a long
    time without giving or receiving a wound, which was the cause that the
    little one, failing to parry so exactly, being tired with this long
    battle, received a stroke on his wounded wrist, which dividing the
    sinews, he remained vanquished, and the tall conqueror received the
    applause of the spectators. For my part I should have had more pleasure
    in seeing the battle of the bears and dogs, which was fought the
    following day on the same theatre.”
  </p>

    Just as, early in the eighteenth century, there was a scare about the
    Mohocks, so in the reign of Charles II. there was a scare about the
    so-called “Scowerers.” There were “Roreres,” in the thirteenth century;
    “Roaring Boys,” in the sixteenth; “Scowerers,” in the seventeenth;
    Mohocks in the eighteenth; and Corinthian Tom in the nineteenth
    century. And the facts and achievements of their young bloods are
    always exaggerated. We are now told that the Scowerers assembled in
    bands, stormed taverns, broke windows, upset apple carts, and generally
    showed their indomitable spirit. Shadwell wrote a comedy about them. I
    record the common belief, but doubt the fact.
  </p>

  <p>
    Wrestling, and the sight of wrestling, was a favourite amusement of the
    time:—
  </p>

  <p>
    “In 1681,” (<cite>Manners and Customs</cite>) “the King witnessed a wrestling
    match where the abettors were the Monarch and the Duke of Albemarle:
    a meadow below the castle was the scene of action, and the match
    was composed of twelve men on each side: the King’s party wore red
    waistcoats, and the Duke’s blue: a ring or inclosure was formed, and a
    space in it admitted the Royal coach: the Queen and her ladies viewed
    the contest from the terrace, but the Duke mixed with the crowd.
    The activity displayed on this occasion excited great applause, and
    only one of the number offered foul play, which the Duke punished by
    tripping up his heels.
  </p>

  <p>
    The victory was gained by the blues: and they thus procured their
    employer 200 guineas, the wager depending: the sum of 10s. each was
    given to the King’s men, and 20s. to the victors. After which the
    King’s men challenged the Duke’s at back-sword: in which exercise some
    being unskilful, others were taken in to
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span> complete the number. This was
    performed with great skill and courage, but not attended with those
    barbarous circumstances which were usual with the Roman gladiators,
    who, to shew the Emperor sport, sheathed their swords in one another’s
    bowels: our most clement and gracious King abominating all acts of
    cruelty. The issue of this was only some broken pates, and the palm was
    again given to the blues. The King’s men being heated, and unwilling
    that the Duke’s should thus carry a victory, resolved to have another
    trial with them, and challenged them at football, which being accepted,
    the goals staked out, and the ball placed in the middle, the Duke held
    up an handkerchief over the ball, the letting fall of which was the
    signal to give the start, and the handkerchief a reward to him that
    got the first kick, which was one of the Duke’s men, who (in all three
    exercises) behaved himself so singularly active, that his Majesty took
    particular notice of him, and gave him a guinea. And, notwithstanding
    fortune still appeared on the Duke’s side, his Majesty seemed highly
    pleased with that day’s divertisement.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “One of the most curious and ingenious amusements” ever offered to
    the public ear was contrived in the year 1682, when an elm plank was
    exhibited to the King and the credulous of London, which, being touched
    by a hot iron, invariably produced a sound resembling deep groans.
  </p>

  <p>
    “This sensible and very irritable board received numbers of noble
    visitors: and other boards, sympathising with their afflicted brother,
    demonstrated how much affected they might be by similar means. The
    publicans in different parts of the City immediately applied ignited
    metal to all the woodwork of their houses, in hopes of finding
    sensitive timber: but I do not perceive any one so successful as the
    landlord of the Bowman tavern in Drury Lane, who had a mantle tree
    so extremely prompt and loud in its responses, that the sagacious
    observers were nearly unanimous in pronouncing it part of the same
    trunk which had afforded the original plank.”
  </p>

  <p>
    The following paragraph is from the <cite>Loyal London Mercury</cite>, October 4,
    1682:—
  </p>

  <p>
    “Some persons being this week drinking at the Queen’s Arms tavern in
    St. Martin’s le Grand, in the kitchen, and having laid the fire-fork in
    the fire to light their pipes, accidentally fell a discoursing of the
    groaning board, and what might be the cause of it. One in the company
    having the fork in his hand to light his pipe, would needs make trial
    of a long dresser that stood there, which, upon the first touch, made a
    great noise and groaning, more than ever the board that was shewed did,
    and when they touched it three or four times, and found it far beyond
    the other. They all having seen it, the house is almost filled with
    spectators day and night, and any company calling for a glass of wine
    may see it: which, in the judgment of all, is far louder, and makes a
    longer groan, than the other, which to report, unless seen, would seem
    incredible.”
  </p>

  <p>
    The subject of fairs is treated very fully in the volume on the
    eighteenth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
    century; nevertheless, they cannot be here altogether
    omitted, as they formed one of the chief amusements of the seventeenth
    century.
  </p>

  <p>
    Fairs began by being serious markets, but later became a place of less
    important trade, where lace, gold and silver embroidery, jewellery,
    and finery of every kind were exposed for sale. A further decline took
    place when people of fashion ceased to attend the fair for the purchase
    of these things. Then the fair became frankly a place of amusement and
    pleasure with booths. These are the several stages of a fair: first,
    the exhibition and sale of its staple as wool; next, or in addition,
    its ordinary trade; thirdly, a catering for children and the lower
    class. All this time its shows and amusements are growing of more and
    more importance, until at length they become the principal object of
    the fair. Paul Hentzner, writing in 1598, describes St. Bartholomew’s
    Fair as follows:—
  </p>

  <div class="figcenter">
    <a id="i_333"><img src="images/i_333.jpg" width="620" height="470" alt="" /></a>

      <i>Habit of the</i> <span class="smcap">Lord Mayor</span> <i>of London in 1640</i>.
      &nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="smcap">Habit</span> <i>of the</i> <span class="smcap">Lady
      Mayoress</span> <i>of London in 1640</i>.
      <div class="subcap">From a contemporary print.</div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    “Every year upon St. Bartholomew’s Day, when the Fair is held, it is
    usual for the Mayor, attended by the twelve principal Aldermen, to walk
    into a neighbouring field dressed in his scarlet gown, and about his
    neck a golden chain, to which is
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span> hung a Golden Fleece, and besides,
    that particular ornament (the collar of SS.) which distinguishes the
    most noble Order of the Garter. During the year of his magistracy he is
    obliged to live so magnificently that foreigner or native, without any
    expense, is free, if he can find a chair empty, to dine at his table,
    where there is always the greatest plenty. When the Mayor goes out
    of the precincts of the City a sceptre, a sword, and a cap are borne
    before him, and he is followed by the principal Aldermen in scarlet
    gowns with gold chains, himself and they on horseback. Upon their
    arrival at a place appointed for that purpose, where a tent is pitched,
    the mob begin to wrestle before them, two at a time; the conquerors
    receive rewards from the Mayor. After this is over a parcel of live
    rabbits are turned loose among the crowd, which boys chase with great
    noise. While we were at this show one of our company, Tobias Salander,
    Doctor of Physic, had his pocket picked of his purse, with nine crowns
    (ecus du soleil), which, without doubt, was so cleverly taken from him
    by an Englishman, who always kept very close to him, that the Doctor
    did not in the least perceive it” (<cite>England, as seen by Foreigners</cite>, p.
    107).
  </p>

  <p>
    Hentzner might have observed also that by the law of England the
    cut-purse was liable to execution. In 1612 one John Pelman, a
    cut-purse, was actually hanged for stealing a purse containing forty
    shillings in the King’s Chapel of Whitehall. It is said of him that he
    came in “good and seemly apparel like a Gentleman, a fair black coat
    laced and either lined thorow, or faced, with velvet.” What says and
    sings Nightingale in the play?—

  <p>
    “The Right Honourable Lord Mayor of the City of London and his right
    worshipful brethren the aldermen of the said city, streightly charge
    and command, on the behalf of our sovereign lady the Queen, that all

  </p>

  <p>
    And that no person or persons whatsoever, within the limits and bounds
    of this Fair, presume to break the Lord’s Day in selling, showing, or

    whatsoever, or in sitting, tippling, or drinking in any tavern, inn,
    ale-house, or cook’s-house, or in doing any other thing that may lead
    to the breach thereof, upon the pain and penalties contained in several
    acts of Parliament, which will be severely inflicted upon the breakers
    thereof.
  </p>

  <p>
    And finally, that whatever person soever find themselves aggrieved,
    injured, or wronged by any manner of person in this Fair, that they
    come with their plaints before the stewards in this Fair, assigned
    to hear and determine pleas, and they will minister to all parties
    justice, according to the laws of this land, and the customs of this
    city. God save the Queen!”
  </p>

  <p>
    The mayor, sheriffs, and aldermen sitting on horseback, robed in their
    violet gowns, having made this proclamation at a point between the
    city Fair and that owned by the Warwick or Holland family, as the
    rest of the official rule details, “the proclamation being made, they
    ride through the Cloth Fair, and so return back again, through the
    Churchyard of Great St. Bartholomew’s to Aldersgate, and so ride home
    again to the Lord Mayor’s house.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “It is remarkable,” to quote from a scarce tract of 1641, which is
    given at length by Morley, “and worth your observation, to behold
    and hear the strange sights and confused noises in the fair. Here a
    Knave in a Fool’s Coat, with a trumpet sounding, or on a drum beating,
    invites you and would fain persuade you to see his puppets; there a
    Rogue like a Wild Woodman, or in an antick shape like an Incubus,
    desires your company to view his motion; on the other side, Hocus
    Pocus with three yards of tape or ribbon in’s hand, showing his art
    of Legerdemain to the admiration and astonishment of a company of
    cockaloaches. Amongst these you shall see a gray goose-cap (as wise as
    the rest), with a What do ye lack? in his mouth, stand in his booth
    shaking a rattle or scraping on a fiddle, with which children are so
    taken, that they presently cry out for these fopperies; and all these
    together make such a distracted noise, that you would think Babel were
    not comparable to it. Here there are also your gamesters in action;
    some turning of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
    whimsey, others throwing for pewter, who can quickly
    dissolve a round shilling into a three-halfpenny saucer.
  </p>

  <p>
    Long Lane at this time looks very fair, and puts out her best clothes
    with the wrong side outward, so turned for their better turning off;
    and Cloth Fair is now in great request; well fare the Ale houses
    therein; yet better many a man fare (but at a dearer rate) in the Pig
    market, <i xml:lang="la">alias</i> Pasty nook or Pie Corner, where pigs are all hours of
    the day on the stalls piping hot, and would cry (if they could speak),
    ‘Come eat me’; but they are dear, and the reckonings for them are
    saucy.”
  </p>

    D’Urfey’s verses, written in 1655, do not present a fair quite without

    Henry III. proclaimed a fifteen days’ fair to begin on the 13th of
    October 1248, the Day of the Translation of St. Edward (<cite> Matthew
    Paris</cite>, ii. p. 272)—
  </p>

  <p>
    “On the 13th of October in this year, in the fortnight of Michaelmas,
    the king proceeded to London, to keep the feast of St. Edward, that
    is, of the translation of that saint, and sent word to a great number
    of the prelates and nobles, begging them, out of their friendship and
    devotion to him, to make their appearance at Westminster, to join with
    him in solemnly and devoutly celebrating the feast of St. Edward.
    At this summons, therefore, there came thither Earl Richard, Roger
    Bigod, earl marshal, the Earl of Hereford, some select barons, and
    certain knights, the bishops of Winchester, London, Ely, Worcester,
    and Carlisle, and a great number of abbots and priors. The king then
    declared it as his pleasure, and ordered it to be proclaimed by herald
    throughout the whole city of London and elsewhere, that he instituted
    a new fair to be held at Westminster, to continue for a fortnight
    entire. He also strictly interdicted, under penalty of heavy forfeiture
    and loss, all fairs which usually lasted for such a length of time in
    England; for instance, that of Ely and
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span> other places, and all traffic
    usually carried on at London, both in and out of doors, in order
    that by these means the Westminster fair might be more attended by
    people, and better supplied with merchandise. In consequence of this,
    innumerable people flocked thither from all quarters, as to the most
    famous fair, and the translation of St. Edward was celebrated, and
    the blood of Christ worshipped to an unexampled degree by the people
    there assembled. But all the merchants, in exposing their goods for
    sale there, were exposed to great inconveniences, as they had no
    shelter except canvas tents; for, owing to the changeable gusts of wind
    assailing them, as is usual at that time of the year, they were cold
    and wet, and also suffered from hunger and thirst; their feet were
    soiled by the mud, and their goods rotted by the showers of rain; and
    when they sat down to take their meals in the midst of their family by
    the fireside knew not how to endure this state of want and discomfort.
    The bishop of Ely, in consequence of the loss of his fair at Ely, which
    was suspended by the king’s warrant, made a heavy complaint to him in
    the matter for introducing such novelties, but he gained nothing but
    words of soothing promises of future consolation.”

      <span class="subhead">COACHES</span>
    </h3>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">
    <span class="smcap">The</span> seventeenth century witnessed the invention of the stage coach, and
    therefore the improvement of the roads. The horse litter was still used
    in the first half of the century. Marie de Medici, when she visited
    her daughter Henrietta in 1638, entered London in a litter. In 1640
    Evelyn travelled in a litter from Bath to Wootton with his father, who
    was suffering from a dropsy, which killed him. The first stage coach
    was a waggon. A service of waggons was established between London and
    Liverpool; there were waggons also between London and York, and between
    London and other towns. M. de Sorbière, visiting London in the reign of
    Charles II., says that rather than use the stage coach he travelled in
    a waggon drawn by a team of six horses. Therefore the Dover stage coach
    had already begun to run, and it was not thought more convenient than
    the waggon. Probably it was more liable to be upset. In 1663 one Edward
    Parker of Preston wrote to his father saying that he had got to London
    in safety on the coach, riding in the boot; that the company was good,
    “Knightes and Ladyes,” but the journey tedious.
  </p>

  <p>
    Coaches at first had no springs, so that the occupants were tossed
    about. “Men and women are so tossed, tumbled, jumbled, and rumbled.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Stow attributes the introduction of coaches into England to one
    Guilliam Boonen, a Dutchman, who became the Queen’s coachman in 1564.
    He is wrong about the introduction of coaches, but he is right in
    saying that within the next twenty years there grew up a great trade in
    coachbuilding, to the jealousy of the watermen.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Coaches and sedans (quoth the waterman), they deserve both to be
    thrown into the Theames, and but for stopping the channell I would they
    were, for I am sure where I was woont to have eight or tenne fares in
    a morning I now scarce get two in a whole day: our wives and children
    at home are readie to pine, and some of us are faine for meanes to take
    other professions upon us.”
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span></p>

  <p>Taylor, the water-poet, thus speaks of coaches:—</p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">“Carroaches, coaches, jades, and Flanders mares,</div>

        <div class="i1">Against the ground we stand and knocke our heeles,</div>
        <div class="i1">Whilest all our profit runs away on wheeles:</div>
        <div class="i1">And whosoever but observes and notes</div>
        <div class="i1">The great increase of coaches and of boates,</div>
        <div class="i1">Shall finde their number more than e’r they were</div>

        <div class="i1">Then water-men at sea had service still,</div>

  <p>
    In the year 1601 the attention of Parliament was called to the increase
    of coaches, and a Bill was brought in “to restrain the excessive use of
    coaches.” This, however, was rejected on the second reading.
  </p>

  <p>
    Attacked or defended, the stage coach, once started, could never be
    abolished. The first stage coach of the City was the hackney coach,
    which was established by one Captain Busby in 1625. He posted four
    coaches at the Maypole in the Strand, with instructions to his men to
    carry people to any part of the town. Twelve years later there were
    fifty; in 1652 there were two hundred; in 1694, seven hundred. The
    coach hire was eighteenpence the first hour, one shilling afterwards.
    The first coaches had no windows, but, in their place, perforated metal
    shutters; the glass coach was introduced about the year 1667. Lady
    Peterborough forgot that there was glass over the door and ran her head
    through it.
  </p>

  <p>
    The sedan chair was introduced by Sir Saunders Duncombe in 1634. As for
    stage vehicles there were at first “long waggons,” and these as early
    as 1564. The following extracts from Journals (<cite>Archæologia</cite>) show that
    there were many stage coaches as early as 1659 and 1660:—
  </p>

  <p>
    “1659. May 2nd, I set forwards towards London by Coventre Coach: 4th I
    came to London.
  </p>

  <p>
    1660. March 13th, my daughter Lettice went towards London in Coventre
    Waggon.
  </p>

  <p>
    1662. June 28th, given 16s. in earnest, and for my passage with my man
    in Aylesbury Coach on Thursday next.
  </p>

  <p>
    1663. January 27th, I went to Baginton [with his own horses, it would
    appear], 28th to Towcester: 29th to St. Albans, 30th by St. Albans
    Coach to London.
  </p>

  <p>
    1677. April 8th, I went to Coventre: 9th thence to Woburne by Chester
    Coach: 10th to London.
  </p>

  <p>
    1679. July 16th, I came out of London by the Stage Coach of Bermicham
    to Banbury.
  </p>

  <p>
    1680. June 30th, I came out of London in the Bedford Stage Coach to the
    Earle of Aylesburie’s house at Ampthill.”
  </p>

  <p>
    From the diary of a Yorkshire clergyman, lent by the Rev. Mr. Hunter,
    one gathers that in the winter of 1682 a journey from Nottingham
    to London in a stage coach occupied four whole days. One of this
    gentleman’s fellow-travellers was Sir Ralph Knight, of Langold in
    Yorkshire (an officer in Monk’s army), so that Mr. Parker was not
    singular in having as his companion in such a conveyance “persons of
    great quality, as Knights and Ladyes.”
  </p>

  <p>
    In 1661 there was a stage coach running between Oxford and London,
    taking two days, <i xml:lang="la">i.e.</i> thirty miles a day, or about three miles an
    hour. The fare was two shillings. A coach with four horses carried
    six passengers, a long waggon with four or five horses twenty to
    twenty-five.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span></p>

  <p>
    In 1663 there was a stage coach between London and Edinburgh once a
    month, taking twelve days for the journey, <i xml:lang="la">i.e.</i> thirty-three miles a
    day. In 1697 the stage coach from York to London took six days.
  </p>

  <p>
    Charles II. instituted tolls for the repair of the roads, but they were
    not extended over the whole of the country till 1767. In 1675 Lady
    Russell writes that it is not possible to describe the badness of the
    roads between Sevenoaks and Tunbridge Wells.
  </p>

  <p>
    Post horses were threepence a mile, riding horses 2s. the first day,
    and 1s. a day afterwards, the hirer to pay for food and to bring back
    the horse.
  </p>

  <p>
    The fare for travelling in a stage coach was a shilling for every five
    miles; therefore, for the journey from London to York it would be forty
    shillings.
  </p>

  <p>
    There were pamphlets for and against the use of the stage coach; it
    caused those who travelled in it to contract “an idle habit of body;
    they became heavy and listless when they rode a few miles, and were not
    able to endure frost, snow, or rain, or to lodge in the field.” This
    seems a very sound objection; there can be no doubt that when everybody
    rode or walked, people were much hardier to stand against cold or heat.
    On the other hand the stage coach had its defenders. One of them says
    that “there is of late such an admirable commodiousness, both for men
    and women, to travel from London to the principal towns in the country,
    that the like hath not been known in the world, and that is by stage
    coaches, wherein any one may be transported to any place sheltered from
    foul weather and foul ways.”
  </p>

  <p>The writer of a pamphlet in 1675 thus denounces them:—</p>

  <p>
    “There is not the fourth part of saddle-horses either bred, or kept,
    now in England, that was before these coaches were set up, and would be
    again, if they were suppressed, nor is there any occasion for breeding,
    or keeping such horses, whilst the coaches are continued. For, will any
    man keep a horse for himself and another for his man, all the year, for
    to ride one or two journeys: that at pleasure, when he hath occasion,
    can slip to any place where his business lies, for two, three or four
    shillings, if within twenty miles of London: and so proportionately
    into any part of England: No: there is no man: unless some noble soul,
    that scorns and abhors being confined to so ignoble, base, and sordid a
    way of travelling as these coaches oblige him unto. For formerly every
    man that had occasion to travel many journeys yearly, or to ride up
    and down, kept horses for himself and servants, and seldom rid without
    one or two men: but now, since every man can have a passage into every
    place he is to travel unto, or to some place within a few miles of
    that part he designs to go unto, they have left keeping of horses, and
    travel without servants; and York, Chester, and Exeter stage-coaches,
    each of them, with forty horses apiece, carry eighteen passengers a
    week from London to either of these places: and, in like manner, as
    many in return from these places to London: which come, in the whole,
    to eighteen hundred and seventy-two in the year. Now take it for
    granted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
    that all that are carried from London to those places are the
    same that are brought back: yet are there nine hundred and thirty-six
    passengers carried by forty horses: whereas, were it not for these
    coaches, at least five hundred horses would be required to perform this
    work.”
  </p>

  <p>
    We have already considered the complaint of the watermen. The stage
    coaches having begun to carry passengers as far as Windsor and
    Maidenhead up the river, and to Greenwich and Gravesend down the river,
    who will take a boat, which is far slower and less comfortable than the
    coach?
  </p>

  <p>
    The next point of consideration is that of His Majesty’s Excise.
    Formerly every traveller of quality rode with his servants, who
    consumed a great quantity of beer and wine on the journey. When coaches
    began, the passengers travelled without any servants at all, to the
    great loss of the inns on the road and the corresponding injury to the
    Excise. And consider the losses inflicted on trade:—
  </p>

  <p>
    “For before these coaches were set up, travellers rode on horseback,
    and men had boots, spurs, saddles, bridles, saddle-cloths, and good
    riding-suits, coats and clokes, stockings and hats: whereby the wool
    and leather of the kingdom was consumed, and the poor people set at
    work by carding, combing, spinning, knitting, weaving, and fulling.
    And your cloth-workers, drapers, tailors, saddlers, tanners, curriers,
    shoemakers, spurriers, lorimers, and felt-makers had a good employ:
    were full of work, got money, lived handsomely, and helped, with
    their families, to consume the provisions and manufactures of the
    kingdom: but by means of these coaches, these trades, besides many
    others depending upon them, are become almost useless: and they,
    with their families, reduced to great necessity: insomuch that many
    thousands of them are cast upon the parishes, wherein they dwell,
    for a maintenance. Besides, it is a great hurt to the girdlers,
    sword-cutlers, gunsmiths, and trunk-makers: most gentlemen, before they
    travelled in their coaches, used to ride with swords, belts, pistols,
    holsters, portmanteaus, and hat-cases: which, in these coaches, they
    have little or no occasion for. For, when they rode on horseback,
    they rode in one suit, and carried another to wear, when they came to
    their journey’s end; or lay by the way: but in coaches, a silk suit
    and an Indian gown with a sash, silk stockings and beaver-hats men
    ride in, and carry no other with them, because they escape the wet
    and dirt, which on horseback they cannot avoid: whereas, in two or
    three journeys on horseback these clothes and hats were wont to be
    spoiled: which done, they were forced to have new very often, and that
    increased the consumption of the manufactures, and the employment of
    the manufacturer: which travelling in coaches doth no way do. And if
    they were women that travelled, they used to have safeguards and hoods,
    side-saddles, and pillions, with strappings, saddle or pillion-cloths,
    which, for the most part, were either laced or embroidered: to the
    making of which there went many several trades: seeing there is not
    one side-saddle with the furniture made, but, before it is furnished,
    there are at least thirty-seven trades have a share
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span> in the making
    thereof: most of which are either destroyed, or greatly prejudiced,
    by the abatement of their trade: which being bread unto, and having
    served seven years’ apprenticeship to learn, they know not what other
    course to take for a livelihood. And, besides all these inferior
    handy-craftsmen there are the mercers, silkmen, lacemen, milliners,
    linen and woollen drapers, haberdashers, and divers other eminent
    trades, that receive great prejudice by this way of travelling. For
    the mercers sold silk and stuff in great quantities for safeguards,
    hoods, and riding clothes for women: by which means the silk-twisters,
    winders, throwsters, weavers, and dyers, had a fuller employment:
    the silkmen sold more lace and embroidery, which kept the silver
    wire-drawers, lace-makers, and embroiderers: and at least ten trades
    more were employed. The linen-draper sold more linen, not only to
    saddlers to make up saddles, but to travellers for their own use:
    nothing wearing out linen more than riding. Woollen-drapers sold more
    cloth than now: saddlers used before these coaches were set up, to buy
    three or four hundred pounds worth of cloth a-piece in a year: nay,
    some five hundred and a thousand pounds worth, which they cut out into
    saddles and pillion-cloths: though now there is no saddler can dispose
    of one hundred pounds worth of cloth in a year in his trade. The
    milliners and haberdashers, they also sold more ribbons, and riding on
    horseback, spoiling and wearing them out, much more than travelling in
    a coach: and, on horseback these things were apter to be lost than in a
    coach.”
  </p>

  <p>And the expense:—</p>

  <p>
    “Men do not travel in these coaches with less expence of money, or
    time, than on horseback: for, on horseback, they may travel faster:
    and, if they please, all things duly considered, with as little if not
    less charges. For instance: from London to Exeter, Chester, or York,
    you pay forty shillings a-piece in summer-time, forty-five shillings in
    winter, for your passage: and as much from those places back to London.
    Besides, in the journey they change coachmen four times: and there are
    few passengers that give twelve-pence to each coachman at the end of
    his stage: which comes to eight shillings in the journey backward and
    forward, and at least three shillings comes to each passenger’s share
    to pay for the coachmen’s drink on the road: so that in summer-time the
    passage backward and forward to any of these places costs four pounds
    eleven shillings, in the winter five pounds one shilling. And this
    only for eight days riding in the summer, and twelve in the winter.
    Then, when the passengers come to London, they must have lodgings:
    which, perhaps, may cost them five or six shillings a week, and that
    in fourteen days amounts unto ten or twelve shillings, which makes
    the four pounds eleven shillings either five pounds one shilling, or
    five pounds three shillings: or the five pounds one shilling, five
    pounds eleven shillings, or five pounds thirteen shillings: beside
    the inconvenience of having meat from the cooks, at double the price
    they might have it for in inns. But if stage coaches were down and men
    travelled as formerly, on horseback,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
    then when they came into their
    inns they would pay nothing for lodgings: and as there would excellent
    horses be bred and kept by gentlemen for their own use, so would there
    be by others that would keep them on purpose to let: which would, as
    formerly, be let at ten or twelve shillings per week, and in many
    places for six, eight, or nine shillings a week. But admitting the
    lowest price to be twelve shillings, if a man comes from York, Exeter,
    or Chester, to London: be five days coming, five days going, and say
    twelve days in London to dispatch his business (which is the most that
    country chapmen usually do stay) all this would be but three weeks:
    so that his horse-hire would come but to one pound sixteen shillings,
    his horse-meat at fourteen pence a day, one with another, which is the
    highest that can be reckoned upon, and will come but to one pound five
    shillings, in all three pounds one shilling: so that there would be, at
    least, forty or fifty shillings saved of what coach-hire and lodgings
    will cost him: which would go a great way in paying for riding-clothes,
    stockings, hats, boots, spurs, and other accoutrements for riding:
    and, in my poor opinion, would be far better spent in the buying of
    these things, by the making whereof the poor would be set at work, and
    kept from being burthensome to the parish, than to give it to those
    stage-coachmen, to indulge that lazy, idle habit of body, that men, by
    constant riding in these coaches have brought upon themselves.”

    </h3>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">
    <span class="smcap">In</span> the following chapter will be found certain notes on crime and
    criminals. There is little difference between the crimes of the
    Elizabethan and those of the Stuart period. I have added two or three
    stories of the period which seem to affect the manners of London.
    Hundreds of such stories might be found scattered up and down the
    annals of the seventeenth century. I have made these meagre selections
    with sparing hand. The crime of Lord Sanquhar; the cruelty of the
    Puritan in his punishments; an example of the honest citizen; the
    treachery of a noble lord; the origin of General Monk’s wife, and one
    or two more persons and episodes may be taken as illustrations of the
    times.
  </p>

  <p>
    The punishment of criminals under the English law remained all
    through the century cruel and vindictive. High treason continued to
    be punished with the old barbarities; we have seen what these were.
    The coiner, if a man, was drawn on a hurdle and hanged; if a woman,
    she was burned alive. For petty treason, which is the murder of a
    master, a husband, or a superior officer, the offender was hanged if
    a man; burned if a woman. For felony of all kinds, hanging. If a man
    refused to plead he was pressed to death. After death, the body was
    sometimes hung in chains. In felonies where Benefit of Clergy was
    still allowed, the offender was branded on the left hand. For petty
    larceny, the punishments were the loss of an ear, or a whipping.
    Perjury was punished with pillory, with branding on the forehead,
    while the offender’s trees were pulled up in his garden and his goods
    confiscated. Forgery, cheating, libelling, using false weights and
    measures, forestalling the market, offending against the statutes
    in bakery and brewery, were punished with pillory, and sometimes by
    nailing one or both ears to the pillory, or cutting them off, or boring
    through the tongue with a hot iron. For striking in the King’s Court
    the right hand was struck off. For striking in Westminster Hall while
    the judges were sitting, the punishment was imprisonment for life and
    confiscation of the offender’s goods.
  </p>

  <p>
    If a jury bought in a verdict contrary to evidence they were liable to
    lose the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
    franchise; to be incapable of acting as witness or on a jury,
    to lose their lands and property, and to be imprisoned.
  </p>

  <p>
    The stocks were for drunkards and vagabonds. Scolding women were to be
    ducked in the ducking stool.
  </p>

  <p>
    This goodly array of punishments was in full practice during the
    seventeenth century.
  </p>

  <p>
    There were other crimes not dealt with in this list, especially the
    crime of witchcraft. James has been held up to ridicule for believing
    in witchcraft. This is unjust, because there were very few in the
    country who had the strength of mind to disbelieve it. Fortunately the
    wave of superstitious terror hardly touched London.
  </p>

  <p>
    The practice of duelling could be defended on the ground of its being
    a survival, in a sense, of the old ordeal by battle. James I. was the
    first who made an effort to restrict and abolish the practice.
  </p>

  <p>
    Under the Commonwealth incest and adultery were made felonies.
    Incontinence for the first time was made a criminal offence, to be
    punished by three months’ imprisonment.
  </p>

  <p>
    These few notes on crime and criminal law might seem incomplete without
    mention of the two greatest criminals of the century, Titus Oates and
    Judge Jeffreys. Their crimes, however, have little or nothing to do
    with London save that those of the former were committed for the most
    part in London, and that the latter died in London.
  </p>

  <p>
    The roguery, vice, cheateries, and thieveries practised in the City
    have always been on the grand scale. Perhaps there were no more of
    these things in King Charles’s reign than in our own time. But it seems
    so. To begin with, there were the professed and professional sharps,
    men who lived by their wits. The names by which they were known under
    Queen Bess had been changed; these terms of endearment or of opprobrium
    do not last long. They were now known as Huffs, Rooks, Pads, Pompinios,
    Philo Puttonists, Ruffons, Shabbaroons, and Rufflers. Many of them were
    of good birth and of excellent manners. When one of them extorted all
    his money from a flat it was with an air so engaging that he could not
    resent it; nor could he believe that he had been cheated by loaded dice
    and by marked cards. Not all of them were gentlemen. Thus there was the
    Angler, who carried a stick with a hook at the end, which was useful in
    passing an open shop; there was the Ruffler, who pretended to be an old
    soldier of Marston Moor or Naseby; there was the Wild Rogue, a boy or
    girl who cut off the gold or silver buttons from people in a crowd; the
    Clapper Doyen, who begged about the streets with stolen children; the
    Abram man, a sham madman; the Whip Jack, a sham shipwrecked sailor; the
    Mumper, a decayed merchant; and the Dommerer, who pretended to be dumb.
  </p>

  <p>
    If we are to believe the revelations of <cite>Meritio Latron</cite>, the City
    ’prentices<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
    contained among them a considerable number of young fellows
    who were common rogues and thieves; they robbed their masters as much
    as they dared, both of money and of goods; they met on Saturday nights
    when the masters were in the country, exchanged the goods, and feasted
    together in company with other rogues of the town. In the same edifying
    work we are instructed concerning the sharp practices and cheateries of
    the various shopkeepers. It is hardly worth while to spend any time in
    enumerating these. They are much the same in every age.
  </p>

  <p>
    The case of Alexander Leighton is one of Royal cruelty. It may be
    placed beside that of Prynne. There are others of Puritanic cruelty
    quite as bad, as will be seen presently.
  </p>

  <p>
    Leighton, a Doctor of Divinity, in 1630, was accused of framing,
    publishing, and dispersing a scandalous book against King, peers, and
    prelate.
  </p>

  <p>He was brought before the Star Chamber, where he received his sentence.</p>

  <p>
    First, he was degraded. He was then whipped and put in pillory. Being
    taken out, his right ear was cut off and the right side of his nose
    slit, and he was branded on the right cheek with the letters S.S.,
    <i xml:lang="la">i.e.</i> Stirrer up of Sedition. He was then taken back to the Fleet for
    a week, after which, his wounds still fresh, he was again whipped,
    again set in pillory, and was then deprived of his remaining ear, had
    the left side of his nose slit, and the left cheek branded.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Puritan was stern and unrelenting in his punishment. Perhaps this
    fact may account for something of the hatred with which he came to
    be regarded by the populace. Take, for instance, the case of Francis
    Prideaux, a poor little petty thief, who would now be let off with a
    month’s imprisonment:—
  </p>

  <p>
    “Francis Prideaux is now convicted of a trespas for unlawfully ripping
    up and taking away lead from the house of Richard Rothwell and is fined
    12d., and must bee stripped naked from the middle upwards on Monday the
    fourteenth day of this instant January betweene the houres of 9 and
    11 of the clocke in the forenoone and then openly whipped on his back
    untill his body be bloddy at the hinder part of a cart from the Old
    Gatehouse through Long Ditch, Duke Street, and Charles Street in the
    parish of St. Margaret’s Westminster, and back againe, from the said
    Charles Street, through Duke Street and Long Ditch, to the said Old
    Gatehouse. Hee is committed to the New Prison of the Gatehouse, ther to
    remayne in safe custody untill he shall undergoe his said punishment,
    and pay his said fine, and then be delivered paying his fees iiis.
    viiid.”
  </p>

  <p>
    The following history of heartless duplicity in high places is told
    in the memoirs of De Grammont. The victim was one of the earliest
    actresses on the stage:—
  </p>

  <p>
    “The Earl of Oxford fell in love with a handsome, graceful actress,
    belonging to the Duke’s theatre, who performed to perfection,
    particularly the part of Roxana in a very fashionable new play:
    insomuch that she ever after retained that name.
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span> This creature being
    both very virtuous and very modest, or, if you please, wonderfully
    obstinate, proudly rejected the presents and addresses of the Earl
    of Oxford. The resistance inflamed his passion: he had recourse to
    invectives and even spells: but all in vain. This disappointment had
    such an effect upon him, that he could neither eat nor drink: this did
    not signify to him: but his passion at length became so violent that he
    could neither play nor smoke. In this extremity, Love had recourse to
    Hymen; the Earl of Oxford, one of the first peers of the realm, is, as
    you know, a very handsome man: he is of the Order of the Garter, which
    greatly adds to an air naturally noble. In short, from his outward
    appearance, you would suppose he was really possessed of some sense:
    but as soon as ever you hear him speak you are perfectly convinced to
    the contrary. This passionate lover presented her with a promise of
    marriage in due form, signed with his own hand: she would not, however,
    rely upon this: but the next day she thought there could be no danger,
    when the Earl himself came to her lodgings attended by a clergyman and
    another man for a witness: the marriage was accordingly solemnized
    with all due ceremonies, in the presence of one of her fellow-players,
    who attended as a witness on her part. You will suppose, perhaps, that
    the new countess had nothing to do but to appear at court according
    to her rank, and to display the earl’s arms upon her carriage. This
    was far from being the case. When examination was made concerning the
    marriage, it was found to be a mere deception: it appeared that the
    pretended priest was one of my lord’s trumpeters, and the witness his
    kettle-drummer. The parson and his companion never appeared after the
    ceremony was over, and as for the other witness, he endeavoured to
    persuade her that the Sultana Roxana might have supposed in some part
    or other of a play, that she was really married. It was all to no
    purpose that the poor creature claimed the protection of the laws of
    God and man: both which were violated and abused, as well as herself,
    by this infamous imposition: in vain did she throw herself at the
    king’s feet to demand justice: she had only to rise up again without
    redress: and happy might she think herself to receive an annuity of one
    thousand crowns, and to resume the name of Roxana, instead of Countess
    of Oxford.”
  </p>

  <p>
    The strange story of Lord Sanquhar’s revenge belongs to the reign
    of James the First; it is the story of a madman: a man who went mad
    with brooding over a sense of shame. He was a Scottish nobleman, and
    he came to Whitefriars to practise fencing with one or other of the
    fencing-masters who had lodgings in Alsatia. He was playing with a
    master named Turner, and in the course of their play he received the
    point or the button of his adversary’s foil in his eye, the result of
    which accident was the loss of that eye altogether. The accident, it is
    said, was much regretted by Turner; considering how much it reflected
    upon his professional skill, this is not surprising. Lord Sanquhar,
    however, sometime visited the court of the French King Henry IV. When
    the King was in discourse with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
    him he observed the loss of the eye and asked how that occurred. “By a
    sword,” said Sanquhar. “Does the man live?” asked the King.
  </p>

  <p>
    This question set Lord Sanquhar brooding over the thing until he
    persuaded himself that his honour demanded the death of Turner. It
    is, however, wonderful that he should have perversely believed that
    his honour demanded the murder of Turner by two hired assassins. It
    was five years after the accident of the foil. The two men went to
    Whitefriars about seven in the evening. They found Turner sitting
    before his house with a friend. Apparently Turner knew them, for he
    invited them to drink; whereupon one of them, Carliel, turning round to
    cock the pistol, presented it and fired, the bullet entering the man’s
    heart, so that he fell back, dead. They then fled; one of them ran up a
    <i xml:lang="fr">cul de sac</i> and was taken on the spot; the other tried to escape into
    Scotland; and Lord Sanquhar tried to hide himself in the country.
  </p>

  <p>
    They were all three caught. The two murderers were hanged opposite the
    great gate of Whitefriars—now the entrance to Bouverie Street; the
    noble lord was hanged in New Palace Yard.
  </p>

  <p>
    We hear a great deal about debtors’ prisons in the course of the
    eighteenth century. Some effort was made in the seventeenth century to
    investigate their condition.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 1677 a committee was appointed to examine into the security, not
    the proper treatment, of the prisoners of the King’s Bench and Fleet
    Street. Joseph Cooling, Marshal of the Marshalsea, deposed that he had
    given, for his office, security for £10,000 and paid, besides, a rent
    of £1400 a year. He said that he gave no liberty to the prisoners to
    go out; that those who would not find security were not allowed even
    to leave the Rules unless attended by his servants; that his servants
    saw that everybody was in his lodging at nightfall; that some prisoners
    had a whole house to themselves; that the reason of the Rules was that
    the prison would not hold all the prisoners; that there was a table of
    fees, and that he never took more than the table allowed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Manlove, Warden of the Fleet, deposed that his office was taxed at £600
    a year; that he took security from the prisoners before he suffered
    them to go into the Rules, and so on.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then came the evidence of ten prisoners. They swore that when the
    Commissioners of Bankrupts went to the prison in order to examine one
    Farrington, the Marshal could only produce him twice out of eleven
    times that he was wanted; that when the Commissioners’ messenger
    entered the prison, the prisoners jumped upon him. The evidence on this
    point is not clear. Robert Black, another prisoner, gave evidence as to
    the Marshal’s exactions and tyranny. He himself had signed a petition
    against these exactions, and was in consequence forcibly removed to the
    poor side, where the exercise yard was encumbered with sheds and where
    he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
    had to sleep in a damp cellar 4 feet underground, 18 feet square,
    with nineteen others: that prisoners had been locked up day and night,
    their friends refused admission to them. This evidence of Robert Black
    was confirmed by others.
  </p>

  <p>
    Anne Moseley, another prisoner, gave evidence as to the filthy
    condition of the place where she had to sleep; she also accused the
    Marshal of taking £10 from her for permission to live at home and then
    putting her on the poor side. George Phillips, another prisoner, swore
    that he, with three others, was put into a room 16 feet by 15 feet, for
    which they had to pay a rent of £24:6:6 a year, though it was worth
    no more than £4 a year; that the Marshal let a number of such rooms,
    some of them worth no more than £6 a year, at rents of £24, £36, £46,
    and £62 a year.
  </p>

  <p>
    Other prisoners deposed that whereas a table of fees had been laid down
    by a commissioner in the third year of Queen Elizabeth and exhibited
    in a frame hung up in the common hall of the prison; and whereas the
    scale of fees had been further established by the 22nd and 23rd Charles
    II., the warden of the Fleet, Richard Manlove, levied larger fees and
    threatened to put the prisoners in irons if they were not paid.
  </p>

  <p>
    There does not appear, however, to have been any redress of these
    grievances. The difficulty in the minds of the judges was not as to the
    treatment of the prisoner by the wardens, but as to their safe custody
    and the keepers’ court before which the wardens should be tried in
    case of allowing the prisoners to escape. In other words, a prisoner
    for debt was regarded partly as a criminal who was rightly punished
    by being kept in a damp dungeon, and nearly starved to death, and
    partly as an obstinate person who refused to pay his just debts and was
    therefore very properly maltreated.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the year 1613 Mr. R. J., moved by the consideration of the
    wickedness to be found in this City, and of the dangers and temptations
    to which young men are exposed, completed a pamphlet of warning and
    exposure. It is entitled “Looke on me London.” The title page goes on:—
  </p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">“I am an honest Englishman, ripping up the bowels</div>
        <div class="i1">of mischief lurking in thy Suburbs and Precincts.</div>
        <div class="i20">Take heed</div>
        <div class="i1">The hangman’s halter and the Beadle’s Whip,</div>
        <div class="i1">Will make the Fool dance and the Knave to skip.”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    The pamphlet shows, what one might have suspected, the protection
    afforded by the suburbs and parts of London outside the City and
    the liberties where the Lord Mayor had no jurisdiction. It was
    at an innocent-looking ordinary that the young man first met the
    companion who led him to destruction. He was a handsome, well-dressed,
    well-spoken gentleman; he was free with his money; his manners were
    easy and courteous; he laughed readily; he was known at the house,
    where the drawers ran to fetch him all he wanted; it was an act of
    courtesy when he spoke to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
    the young gentleman come up from the country
    to study law, as becomes one who will be a country gentleman and will
    live on his estate. This brave gentleman not only condescended to
    speak to the stranger, but he began to talk to him of the sights and
    pleasures of the town. Would he see the play? The Curtain Theatre was
    open that afternoon. Would he cross the river to see a famous fencing
    match at which two would fight till one was disabled? Would he choose
    rather a bear-baiting? There would be one in Paris Gardens, or, if
    he liked it better, the gentleman knew where a gaming table could be
    found, or a quiet hour could be spent over the dice. Or—and here he
    whispered—would the young gentleman like to visit a certain <i xml:lang="it">bona roba</i>
    of his acquaintance? Upon her and her friends this friendly person
    enlarged with so much eloquence that the young gentleman was inflamed,
    and, forgetting his principles and his virtue, begged his friend to
    take him to the house of these celestial beings.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now this gallant of such worshipful appearance was nothing but a
    “shifter” who lived by picking up such simple persons, enticing them
    into the company of disorderly women, cheating at cards and dice.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Yet for all this, my brave Shifter hath a more costly reckoning to
    give him, for being thus growne into acquaintance, hee will in a
    familiar kinde of courtesie accompany him up and downe the Citty,
    and in the end will come unto a Mercer’s or Gold-smith’s shoppe,
    of whom the young Gentleman is well knowne; there will he cheapen
    velvet, satten, jewels, or what him liketh, and offer his new friend’s
    credit for the payment; he will with so bold a countenance aske this
    friendship, that the Gentleman shall bee to seeke of excuse to deny
    him: well, although the penyworths of the one bee not very good, yet
    the payment of the other is sure to bee currant.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thus, by prodigall ryots, vaine company, and rash suretiship many of
    our English yong Gentlemen are learned to say—
  </p>

  <div class="center-container">
    <div class="poetry">
      <div class="stanza">
        <div class="i0">‘I wealthy was of late,</div>
        <div class="i1">Though needy now be:</div>
        <div class="i1">Three things have changed my state.</div>
        <div class="i1">Dice, Wine, and Venerie.’”</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Presently the young gentleman falls into the hands of the money-lender:—</p>

  <p>
    “After all this there seizeth upon the needy Gentleman thus consumed
    another Devouring Caterpillar, which is the Broker for money: one
    that is either an old Banker-out citizen, or some smooth-conditioned
    unthrifty Gentleman farre in debt, some one of these will helpe him to
    credit with some of their late creditors with a single protestation
    of meere curtesie. But by your favour, they will herein deale most
    cunningly. For the citizen Broker (after money taken out for his
    paines, considering for the time given, and losse in selling of the
    wares put together) will bring the yong Gentleman fifty pounds currant
    money for a hundred pounds good debt.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span></p>

  <p>
    Mary, the Gentleman broker will deale more gallanter, for he will be
    bounde with his fellow Gentleman for a hundred pound, sharing the money
    equally betweene them, not without solemne promise to discharge his
    owne fifty, and if need be, the whole hundred pounds assurance.”
  </p>

  <p>The worst places are the gaming houses.</p>

  <p>
    “Thus one mischiefe drawes on another, and in my opinion gaming houses
    are the chiefe Fountaines thereof; which wicked places first nourisheth
    our yong men of England in pride, then acquainteth them with sundry
    shifting companions, whereof one sort cozeneth them at dice, cardes,
    another sort consume them with riotous meetings, another sort by
    Brokage bringeth them in debt, and out of credite, and then awaiteth
    covetousnesse and usury to cease upon their livings, and the officious
    sergiant upon their liberties: and all this (as I said before)
    principally proceeds by the frequenting of gaming houses.”
  </p>

  <p>Where do the rogues of all kinds haunt and find refuge?</p>

  <p>
    “Now remaineth the discovery of the third sort of these haunts, which
    are placed in the suburbs of the Citty, in Allies, Gardanes, and
    other obscure corners, out of the common walkes of the magistrates.
    The daily Guestes of these privy houses are maister-lesse men, needy
    Shifters, Theeves, Cut-purses, unthrifty servants, both serving-men and
    Prentises: Here a man may picke out mates for all purposes save such
    as are good: here a man may finde out fellowes, that for a bottle of
    wine will make no more conscience to kill a man than a butcher a beast:
    Here closely lie Saint Nicholas Clearkes, that with a good Northerne
    Gelding, will gaine more by a Halter, than an honest yeoman will with a
    teame of good horses: Here are they that will not let to deceive their
    father, to rob their brother, and fire their neighbour’s house for an
    advantage. These brave companions will not sticke to spend frankly
    though they have neither lands nor goods by the dead, nor honestly by
    nature. But how will this hold out; Fire will consume wood without
    maintenance, and Ryot make a weake purse without supply.
  </p>

  <p>
    Gentlemen (for the most part) have lands to make money, and the yong
    citizens way to get credite: but these idle fellowes have neither lands
    nor credite, nor will live by any honest meanes or occupation: yet have
    they hands to filtch, heads to deceive, and friends to receive, and by
    these helpes, most commonly shift they badly well.
  </p>

  <p>
    The other upon currant assurance, perhaps, get money for twenty pounds
    in the hundred, but these that worst may hold the candle: they upon
    their owne, or upon their maisters apparell, Brasse, Pewter, Linnin,
    Wollen, or such like, will find Brokers or Friperers, that for eight
    pence in the pound for every monthe’s use, will boldly for halfe the
    value take these pawnes.”
  </p>

  <p>
    The writer goes on to describe some of the tricks of usurers. They are
    so hard-hearted—but he does not consider that the profession must begin
    with a flinty heart—<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
    that they neither fear God nor reverence man;
    that they will neither pardon their own father nor acknowledge their
    mother, nor regard their brothers, and will even make merchandise of
    their own children. They bear false evidence, “offend the widow and
    oppress the orphan. Oh, how great is this folly of theirs! to lose
    life, to seek death, and to banish themselves from heaven eternally.”
    As for the various tricks that are practised:—
  </p>

  <p>
    “I know a Broker that will take no interest for his money, but will
    have the lease of your house, or your land, in use, receiving rent for
    the same till you pay your principall againe, which will come to a
    greater gaine than threescore in the hundred. I knowe another that will
    take no interest money, but will have Pewter, Brasse, Sheetes, Plate,
    Table-Clothes, Napkins, and such like things, to use in his house, till
    his money come home, which will loose more in the wearing than the
    interest of the money will come to.
  </p>

  <p>
    I know another that will take a pawne twice worth the money that hee
    lends, and agree with the Borrower to redeeme it at a day, or loose
    it, by which meanes the poore borrower is forced sometimes for want of
    money to loose his pawne for halfe the valew.
  </p>

  <p>
    I know another that will not lend, but buy at small prices, and
    covenant with the borrower to buy the same againe, at such a price, at
    such a day, or loose it. This is a fellow that seekes to cozen the Law,
    but let him take heed lest the devill his good maister cozens not him,
    and at the last carry him post into hell.
  </p>

  <p>
    I know another that will lend out his money to men of occupations, as
    to Butchers, Bakers, and such like, upon conditions to bee partners in
    their gaines but not in their losses, by which meanes hee that takes
    all the paines and ventures all is forced to give the Broker halfe the
    profit for his money.
  </p>

  <p>
    I know another, for his money lending to a Carpenter, a Brick-layer, or
    a Plaisterer, will agree with them for so many daies worke, or so many
    weekes, for the loane of his money, which if all reckonings bee cast
    will come to a deere interest.
  </p>

  <p>
    I know many about this citty that will not bee seene to be Brokers
    themselves, but suffer their wives to deale with their money, as to
    lend a shilling for a peny a weeke. To Fish-wives, Oister-women,
    Oringe-wenches and such like, these be they that looke about the citty
    like rats and weasels, so gnaw poore people alive, and yet go invisible.
  </p>

  <p>
    This if it be well considered of, is a Jewish Brokage, for indeed the
    Jewes first brought usury and brokage into England, which now by long
    sufferance have much blemished the ancient vertues of this Kingdome:
    let us but remember this one example, how that in the time of King
    Henry the Third, the good cittizens of London, in one night slew five
    hundred Jewes, for that a Jew took a Christian penny in the shilling
    usury, and ever after got them banished the city: but surely those
    Brokers aforesaid deserve worse than Jewes, for they be like unto
    Strumpets,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
    for they receive all men’s money, as well the Beggar’s as
    the Gentleman’s: nay, they will themselves take money upon Brokage, to
    bring their trade into a better Custome, which in my minde is a wicked
    custome to live only by sinne.”
  </p>

  <p>
    In the New Exchange, Strand, at the sign of the “Three Spanish
    Gypsies,” lived from 1632 to 1649 Thomas Ratford and Ann his wife. They
    kept a shop for the sale of washballs, powder, gloves, and such things;
    the wife taught girls plain work, and about the year 1667 she became
    sempstress to Monk, then a Colonel, and carried linen to his place. Her
    father was one John Clarges, a farrier at the Savoy, and farrier to
    Colonel Monk in 1632. He was a man of some success in trade, because he
    promoted a Maypole on the site of the Strand Cross. He died in 1648. In
    1649 Mrs. Ratford and her husband “fell out and parted.” In 1652 she
    married General Monk.
  </p>

  <p>
    Years afterwards the question arose in a court of law whether Ratford
    was dead at the time of the marriage. Witnesses swore they had seen
    him, but as he had never turned up to receive money due to him, which
    was inconceivable if he were living, nor had he visited any of his
    friends, nor was there any occasion why he should have kept out of the
    way, unless it could be proved that the Duchess paid him for silence,
    and as the question was only raised after all were dead, the verdict
    of the jury was in favour of the legality of the marriage. The story
    which represents Ann Clarges as the daughter of a washerwoman who
    carried the linen which her mother had washed to Monk’s house is thus
    completely disproved. Since her father was farrier to Monk in 1632, it
    is possible that he noticed the girl before her marriage; it is also
    quite possible that some kind of <i xml:lang="fr">liaison</i> was carried on between Monk
    and Mrs. Ratford; this perhaps was the reason of the separation, and
    the marriage took place, one thinks, as soon as the death of Ratford
    was known.

    Thomas Bancroft, grandson of Archbishop Bancroft, was for many years
    one of the Lord Mayor’s officers of the City, who in the execution
    of his office, by information and summoning the citizens before the
    Lord Mayor upon the most trifling occasions, and for many things not
    belonging to his office, not only pillaged the poor, but likewise
    many of the rich, who, rather than lose time in appearing before
    the said magistrate, gave money to get rid of this common pest of
    citizens, which, together with his numerous quarterages from brokers,
    annually amassed a considerable sum of money. By these and other
    mercenary practices he effectually incurred the hatred and ill-will
    of the citizens of all denominations, that the persons who attended
    his funeral obsequies with great difficulty saved his corpse from
    being jostled off the bearers’ shoulders in the church by the enraged
    populace, who, seizing the bells, rang them for joy at his unlamented
    death, a deportment heretofore unheard of among the London rabble.

      <span class="subhead">PUBLIC MORALITY</span>
    </h3>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">
    <span class="smcap">In</span> 1679 the Lord Mayor issued a Proclamation in favour of religion,
    morality, and cleanliness which ought to have converted and convinced a
    whole City. It did not, because sinners observed with satisfaction that
    there was no possibility of the pains and penalties being enforced.
    This instructive document deserves to be set forth at length:—
  </p>

  <p>
    “The Right Honourable the Lord Mayor, having taken into his serious
    consideration the many dreadful afflictions which this City hath of
    late years suffered, by a raging plague, a most unheard-of devouring
    fire, and otherwise: and justly fearing that the same have been
    occasioned by the many hainous crying sins and provocations to the
    Divine Majesty: and his Lordship also considering the present dangers
    of greater mischiefs and misery which seem still to threaten this
    City, if the execution of the righteous judgments of God Almighty be
    not prevented by an universal timely repentance and reformation: hath,
    therefore, thought it one duty of his office, being intrusted to take
    all possible care for the good government, peace, and welfare of this
    City, first, to pray and persuade all and every the inhabitants thereof
    to reform, themselves and families, all sins and enormities whereof
    they know themselves to be guilty: and if neither the fear of the Great
    God, nor of His impending judgments shall prevail upon them, he shall
    be obliged to let them know that, as he is their chief Magistrate, he
    ought not to bear the sword in vain: and therefore doth resolve, by
    God’s grace, to take the assistance of his brethren the Aldermen, and
    to require the aid of all the Officers of this City in their several
    places, to punish and suppress according to the laws of the land, and
    the good customs of this City, those scandalous and provoking sins
    which have of late increased and abounded amongst us, even without
    shame, to the dishonour of Christianity, and the scandal of the
    government of this City, heretofore so famous over the world for its
    piety, sobriety, and good order.
  </p>

  <p>
    To the end therefore that the laws may become a terror unto evil-doers,
    and that such, in whose hearts the fear of God and the love of virtue
    shall not prevail,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
    being forewarned, may amend their lives for fear of
    punishment, his Lordship hath thought fit to remember them of several
    penalties provided by law against notorious offenders: as also of
    all Constables and Public Officers (who are to put the said laws in
    execution) of their duty therein.
  </p>

  <p>
    First, every profane curser and swearer ought to be punished by the
    payment of twelve pence for every oath: and if the same cannot be
    levied upon the offender’s goods, then he is to sit three hours in the
    stocks.
  </p>

  <p>
    Secondly, every drunkard is to pay for the first offence five
    shillings: and in default thereof to sit six hours in the stocks,
    and for the second offence to find sureties for the good behaviour
    or to be committed to the common gaol: and the like punishment is to
    be inflicted upon all common haunters of ale-houses and taverns, and
    common gamesters, and persons justly suspected to live by any unlawful
    means, having no visible living. And no person is to sit or continue
    tipling or drinking more than one hour, unless upon some extraordinary
    occasion, in any tavern, victualling-house, ale-house, or other
    tipling-house, upon the penalty of ten shillings for every offence upon
    the master of such house: and upon the person that shall so continue
    drinking, three shillings four pence.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thirdly, every person maintaining houses suspected of common bawdry,
    by the law, is to find sureties for their good behaviour: likewise
    all night-walkers, and persons using that impudent and insufferable
    practice of attempting others’ modesty in the streets, are to be
    punished at the House of Correction, and find sureties for their good
    behaviour.
  </p>

  <p>
    Fourthly, all persons using any unlawful exercises on the Lord’s Day,
    or tipling in taverns, inns or ale-houses, and coffee-houses, during
    divine service on that day, are to forfeit three shillings four pence
    for every offence, to be levied by distress, and where none can be had
    to sit three hours in the stocks: and every vintner, inn-keeper, or
    ale-house keeper that shall suffer any such drinking or tipling in his
    house is to forfeit ten shillings for every offence: and no person may
    sit in the streets with herbs, fruits, or other things, to expose them
    to sale, nor no hackney coachman may stand or ply in the streets on
    that day.
  </p>

  <p>
    And therefore all Constables and other officers, whom it doth or may
    concern, are required according to their oaths solemnly taken in
    that behalf, to take care for discovering and bringing to punishment
    whosoever shall offend in any of the premises: and for that end they
    are to enter into any suspected houses before mentioned to search for
    any such disorderly persons as shall be found misbehaving themselves,
    or doing contrary to the said laws, and to levy the penalties, and
    bring the offenders before some of his Majestie’s Justices of the Peace
    of this City, to be dealt withall according to law.
  </p>

  <p>
    And whereas there are other disorders of another nature very
    dishonourable, and a great scandal to the government of this City, and
    very prejudicial to the trade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
    and commerce of the same: his lordship,
    therefore, is resolved by God’s blessing, with the assistance of his
    brethren the Aldermen, to use his utmost endeavour to prevent the
    same, by putting in execution the good and wholesome laws in force for
    that purpose, with all strictness and severity: some of which he hath
    thought fit to enumerate, with the duties and penalties upon every
    Constable and other officers concerned therein.
  </p>

  <p>
    At first the great resort of rogues, vagrants, idle persons, and common
    beggars, pestring and anoying the streets and common passages, and all
    places of publick meetings and resort, against whom very good provision
    is made by the law, viz.:—
  </p>

  <p>
    That all such persons shall be openly whipped, and forthwith sent from
    parish to parish to the place where he or she was born, if known: if
    not, to the place where he or she last dwelt for the space of one
    year, to be set to work: or not being known where he or she was born
    or dwelt, then to be sent to the parish where he or she last passed
    through without punishment.
  </p>

  <p>
    That every Constable that shall not do his best endeavour for the
    apprehension of such vagabond, rogue, or sturdy beggar, and cause him
    or her to be punished or conveyed according to law, shall forfeit ten
    shillings for every default.
  </p>

  <p>
    Secondly, the not paving and cleansing of the streets: the redressing
    whereof being by a late act of Parliament put into Commissioners
    appointed by Common Council, his Lordship doth hereby recommend the
    same to the Deputies and Common Council of the several wards within
    this City, to use their utmost diligence in that affair, and especially
    to mind their respective Commissioners of the duty incumbent upon them,
    and of the daily damage which the City suffers by the neglect thereof.
    And his Lordship doth declare he will appear at the said Commission of
    Sewers as often as his more urgent occasions will give him leave, and
    doth expect such attendance of the other Commissioners as may render
    the act more effectual than hitherto it hath been.
  </p>

  <p>
    Thirdly, the neglect of the inhabitants of this City in hanging and
    keeping out their lights at the accustomed hours, according to the good
    and ancient usage of this City, and acts of Common Council in that
    behalf.
  </p>

  <p>
    Fourthly, the not setting and continuing the watches at such hours,
    and in such numbers, and in such sober and orderly manner in all other
    respects, as by the acts of Common Council in that behalf is directed
    and appointed.
  </p>

  <p>
    And his Lordship doth strictly require the Fellowship of Carmen to be
    very careful in the due observance of the good and wholesale rules
    and orders which have been made for their regulation: his Lordship
    intending severely to inflict the penalties imposed in default thereof.
  </p>

  <p>
    And to the end that no Constable or other Officers or Ministers of
    Justice may be any ways discouraged in their lawful, diligent, and
    vigorous prosecution of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
    premises, it is provided, that if they
    or any of them shall be resisted, in the just and lawful execution of
    their charge and duty, or in any wise affronted or abused, they shall
    be encouraged, maintained, and vindicated by the justice, order, and
    authority of his Lordship and the Court of Aldermen, and the offenders
    prosecuted and punished according to law.”

      <span class="subhead">GENERAL NOTES</span>
    </h3>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">
    <span class="smcap">Aubrey</span>, writing in 1678, gives some curious notes on the changes of
    manners and customs. Some of his notes refer to the sixteenth century:—
  </p>

  <p>
    “Antiently ordinary men’s houses and copyholders, and the like had no
    chimneys, but flues like louver holes: some of ’em were in being when I
    was a boy.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the halls and parlours of great houses were wrote texts of scripture
    on the painted cloths.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before the last civil wars, in gentlemen’s houses, at Christmas, the
    first dish that was brought to table was a boar’s head, with a lemon in
    his mouth.
  </p>

  <p>
    The first dish that was brought up to table on Easter day was a red
    herring riding away on horseback, <i xml:lang="la">i.e.</i> a herring ordered by the cook
    something after the likeness of a man on horseback set in a corn sallad.
  </p>

  <p>
    The custom of eating a gammon of bacon at Easter (which is still kept
    up in many parts of England) was founded on this, viz. to show their
    abhorrence of Judaism at that solemn commemoration of our Lord’s
    resurrection.
  </p>

  <p>
    The use of your <em>humble servant</em> came first into England on the
    marriage of Queen Mary, daughter of Henry IV. of France, which is
    derived from <i xml:lang="fr">votre très humble serviteur</i>. The usual salutation before
    that time was, <em>God keep you</em>, <em>God be with you</em>, and among the vulgar
    <em>How dost do?</em> with a thump on the shoulder.
  </p>

  <p>
    Till this time the Court itself was unpolished and unmannered: King
    James’s court was so far from being civil to women, that the ladies,
    nay, the Queen herself, could hardly pass by the king’s apartment
    without receiving some affront.
  </p>

  <p>
    Heretofore noblemen and gentlemen of fine estates had their heralds,
    who wore their coats of arms at Christmas and at other solemn times,
    and cried ‘Largesse’ thrice.
  </p>

  <p>
    A neat built chapel, and a spacious hall, were all the rooms of note:
    the rest were small. At Tomarton, in Gloucestershire, antiently the
    seat of the Rivers, is a dungeon 13 or 14 feet deep: about 4 feet
    high are iron rings fastened in the wall, which was probably to tye
    offending villains to, as all lords of manors had this
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span> power over
    their villains (or socage tenants), and had all of them no doubt such
    places for punishment.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was well that all castles had dungeons, and so, I believe, had
    monasteries: for they had often within themselves power of life or
    death.
  </p>

  <p>
    In days of yore lords and gentlemen lived in the country like petty
    kings, had jura regalia belonging to Seignories, had castles and
    boroughs, had gallows within their liberties where they could try,
    condemn and execute: never went to London but in Parliament time, or
    once a year, to do their homage to the king. They always eat in their
    Gothic Halls at the high table or orsille (which is a little room at
    the upper end of the hall where stands a table) with the folks at the
    side table. The meat was served up by watchword. Jacks are but of late
    invention: the poor boys did turn the spit, and licked the dripping for
    their pains: the beds of the men servants and retainers were in the
    hall, as now in the guard or privy chamber here. In the hall mumming
    and loaf stealing and other Christmas sports were performed.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Hearth was commonly in the middle, whence the saying <em>Round about
    our coal fire</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The halls of the Justice of Peace were dreadful to behold. The skreen
    was garnished with corslets and helmets, gaping with open mouths, with
    coats of mail, launces, pikes, halberts, brown bills, bucklers.
  </p>

  <p>
    Public inns were rare: travellers were entertained at religious houses
    for three days together, if occasion served. The meetings of the gentry
    were not at taverns but in the fields or forests with their hawks and
    hounds, and their bugle horns in silken bawderies.
  </p>

  <p>
    Before the Reformation there were no poor’s rates: the charitable doles
    given at the religious houses, and the church ale in every parish, did
    the business.
  </p>

  <p>
    In every parish there was a church-house, to which belonged spits,
    potts, etc., for dressing provision. Here the housekeepers met, and
    were merry and gave their charity. The young people came there too, and
    had dancing, bowling, shooting at butts, etc. Mr. A. Wood assures me
    there were few or no alms-houses before the time of Henry VIII.: that
    at Oxon, opposite Christ Church, was one of the most ancient in England.
  </p>

  <p>In every church there was a poor’s box, and the like at great inns.</p>

  <p>
    Before the wake or feast of the dedication of the church, they sat
    there all night, fasting and praying, viz. on the eve of the wake.
  </p>

  <p>
    The solemnity attending processions in and about churches, and the
    perambulations in the fields were great diversions also of those times.
  </p>

  <p>
    Glass windows in churches and gentlemen’s houses were rare before the
    time of Henry VIII. In my own remembrance, before the civil wars,
    copyholders and poor people had none. In Herefordshire, Monmouthshire,
    and Salop, it is so still. About 90 years ago, noblemen’s and
    gentlemen’s coats were of the fashion of the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span> beadles and yeomen of the
    guard, (<i xml:lang="la">i.e.</i>) gather’d at the middle. The benchers in the Inns of
    Court yet retain that fashion in the make of their gowns.
  </p>

  <p>
    Captain Silas Taylor says, that, in days of yore, when a church was to
    be built, they watched and prayed on the vigil of the dedication, and
    took that part of the horison when the sun arose for the East, which
    makes that variation, so that few stand true except those built between
    the two equinoxes.
  </p>

  <p>
    From the time of Erasmus to about 20 years last past the learning was
    downright pedantry. The conversation and habits of those times were as
    starcht as their bands and square beads, and gravity was then taken
    for wisdom. The doctors in those days were but old boys, when quibbles
    passed for wit even in their sermons.
  </p>

  <p>
    The gentry and citizens had little learning of any kind and their
    way of breeding up their children was suitable to the rest. They
    were as severe to their children as their schoolmasters, and their
    schoolmasters as severe as masters of the house of correction. The
    child perfectly loathed the sight of his parent as the slave to his
    torture. Gentlemen of thirty or forty years old were to stand like
    mutes and fools bareheaded before their parents, and the daughters
    (well grown women) were to stand at the cupboard-side during the whole
    time of the proud mother’s visits unless (as the fashion was) leave was
    forsooth desired that a cushion should be given them to kneel upon,
    brought them by the serving man, after they had done sufficient penance
    in standing.

    The boys (I mean young fellows) had their foreheads turned up, and
    stiffened: they were to stand mannerly forsooth, thus—the foretop
    ordered as before, with one hand at the band-string, the other behind.
  </p>

  <p>
    The gentlemen then had prodigious fans, as is to be seen in old
    pictures, like that instrument which is used to drive feathers: and
    it had a handle at least half as long with which their daughters
    oftentimes were corrected.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sir Edward Coke, Lord Chief Justice, rode the circuit with such a fan:
    Sir William Dugdale told me he was an eye-witness of it.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Earl of Manchester also used such a fan: but the fathers and
    mothers slasht their daughters, in the time of their besom discipline,
    when they were perfect women.
  </p>

  <p>
    At Oxford (and I believe also at Cambridge), the rod was frequently
    used by the tutors and deans: and Dr. Potter of Trinity College, I knew
    right well, whipt his pupil with his sword by his side, when he came to
    take leave of him to go to the Inns of Court.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Misson, whose travels in England were published at the Hague in 1698,
    and a few years later were translated into English, says that he
    “sometimes”—as if the thing was common—met in London a procession
    consisting of a woman bearing the effigy of a man in straw with horns
    upon his head, preceded by a drum and followed by a mob making a noise
    with tongs, gridirons, frying-pans, and saucepans. What
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span> should we
    understand if we met a procession at Charing Cross consisting of four
    men carrying another man, bagpipes and a shawm played before him, a
    drum beating, and twenty links burning around him? The significance of
    this ceremony would be wholly lost and thrown away upon us. It was,
    however, one of many processions which survived from Mediæval London,
    and were understood by everybody. The meaning of it was that a woman
    had given her husband a sound beating for accusing her of infidelity,
    and that upon such occasions, some kind neighbour of the poor innocent
    injured creature—which?—“performed this ceremony.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Again, when Prynne rode up to London to join the Long Parliament, he
    was accompanied by many thousands of horse and foot wearing rosemary
    and bay in their hats and carrying them in their hands, and this
    was considered the greatest affront possible to the judges who had
    questioned him. Why?
  </p>

  <p>
    Of Horn Fair I have elsewhere spoken. This fair kept up to the end
    its semi-allegorical character. No one seems to have known why it was
    kept on October 18, which is St. Luke’s Day, but the Evangelist is
    always figured with a bull’s head in the corner of his portrait. The
    common people, however, associated horns, for some unknown reason,
    with the infidelity of the wife. They therefore assembled at Cuckold’s
    Point opposite Ratcliffe, coming down the river from London, and there
    forming themselves into a procession, marched through Deptford and
    Greenwich to Charlton with horns upon their heads. At the fair horns
    of all kinds, and things made out of horn, were sold; the staple of
    the fair was work in horn, just as the staple of Bartholomew Fair
    was cloth. Besides the casual processions of the mob, a more formal
    procession was organised in London itself, especially at certain inns
    in Bishopsgate. This procession, which seems to have been arranged with
    some care and to have been interesting, consisted of a king, a queen,
    a miller, and other personages; they wore horns in their hats, and on
    arriving at Charlton, walked round the church three times. The occasion
    gave rise to many coarse and ribald jokes, and to much unseemliness of
    all kinds—hence a proverb, “All’s fair at Horn Fair.”
  </p>

  <p>
    In this place the fair is mentioned as one of the last places where
    processions were organised, having meanings which were well understood
    at that time, but which would be now forgotten. The City procession,
    which everybody could read and understand like a printed book, lingered
    long, falling steadily into disuse and disrepute, until the wedding
    march was abandoned; the funeral, stripped of its coats of arms, the
    black gowns, and its torches, and even at last, the march of the
    milkmaids and the Mayday Jack in the Green, were seen no more.

      <span class="subhead">THE COURT</span>
    </h3>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">
    <span class="smcap">The</span> popular imagination pictures the Court of Charles the Second as a
    place of no ceremony or state or dignity whatever; a place where the
    King strolled about and where there was singing of boys, laughter of
    women, tinkling of guitars, playing of cards, making merriment without
    stint or restraint—a Bohemia of Courts. We have been taught to think
    thus of King Charles’s Court by the historian who has seized on one
    or two scenes and episodes—for instance, the last Sunday evening of
    Charles’s life; by the writer of romance, by the chronicler of scandal,
    by the Restoration poets, and the Restoration dramatists.
  </p>

  <p>
    This view of Whitehall after the Restoration is, to say the least,
    incomplete. Charles had a Court, like every other sovereign; he had a
    Court with officers many and distinguished; there were Court ceremonies
    which he had to go through; that part of his private life which is now
    paraded as if it was his public life was conducted with some regard
    to public opinion. What his Court really was may be learned from a
    little book by Thomas De-Laune, Gentleman, called <cite>The Present State of
    London</cite>, published in the year 1681, for George Lurkin, Enoch Prosser,
    and John How, at the <i>Rose and Crown</i>. It may be useful to learn from
    this book the offices and management of a Stuart’s Court.
  </p>


  <h4>I. <span class="smcap">Its Government—Ecclesiastical, Civil, and Military</span></h4>

  <p>
    i. <i>Ecclesiastical.</i>—The Dean of the King’s Chapel was generally a
    Bishop. The Chapel itself is a Royal Peculiar, exempt from episcopal
    visitation. The Dean chose the Sub-Dean or <i xml:lang="la">Precentor Capellæ</i>;
    thirty-six gentlemen of the Chapel, of whom twelve were priests and
    twenty-four singing clerks, twelve children, three organists, four
    vergers, a serjeant, two yeomen, and a Groom of the Chapel. The
    King had his private oratory where every day one of the chaplains
    read the service of the day. Twelve times a year the King, attended
    by his principal nobility, offered a sum of money in gold, called
    the Byzantine gift, because it was formerly coined at Byzantium, in
    recognition of the Grace of God which made him King. James the First
    used a coin with the legend—on one side—“Quid retribuam Domino pro
    omnibus quæ retribuit mihi?” and on the other side—“Cor contritum et
    humiliatum non despiciet Deus.”
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition there were forty-eight Chaplains in Ordinary, of whom four
    every month waited at Court.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Lord High Almoner, usually the Bishop of London, disposed of the
    King’s alms: he received all <i xml:lang="la">deodands</i> and <i xml:lang="la">bona felonum de se</i> to be
    applied to that purpose: Under him were a Sub-Almoner, two Yeomen and
    two Grooms of the Almonry. There was also a Clerk of the Closet whose
    duty was to resolve doubts on spiritual matters. In the reign of good
    King Charles the duties of this officer were probably light.
  </p>


  <h4>II. <span class="smcap">The Civil Government</span></h4>

  <p>
    The chief officer was the Lord Steward. He had authority over all the
    officers of the Court except those of the Chapel, the Chamber, and the
    Stable. He was Judge of all offences committed within the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span> precincts
    of the Court and within the Verge. In the King’s Presence the Lord
    Steward carried a white staff: when he went abroad the White Staff was
    borne before him by a footman bareheaded. His salary was £100 a year
    with sixteen dishes daily and allowances of wine, beer, etc. The Lord
    Chamberlain had the supervision of all officers belonging to the King’s
    Chamber, such as the officers of the wardrobe, of the Revels, of the
    music, of the plays, of the Hunt; the messengers, Trumpeters, Heralds,
    Poursuivants, Apothecaries, Chyrurgeons, Barbers, Chaplains, etc.
  </p>

  <p>
    The third great officer was the Master of the Horse. His duties are
    signified by his title, which was formerly <i xml:lang="la">comes stabuli</i> or Constable.
  </p>

  <p>
    Under these principal officers were the Treasurer of the Household, the
    Comptroller, the Cofferer, the Master of the Household, the two Clerks
    of the Green Cloth, the serjeants, messengers, etc.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the Compting House was held the Court of Green Cloth, which sat
    every day with authority to maintain the Peace within a circle of
    twelve miles radius. It was so called from the colour of the cloth
    spread upon the table.
  </p>

  <p>
    The chief clerk was an official of great power and dignity: he received
    the King’s guests; kept the accounts; looked after the provisions and
    had charge of the Pantry, Buttery and Cellar. There were clerks under
    him. The Knight Harbinger with three Gentlemen Harbingers and seven
    Yeomen Harbingers provided lodgings for the King’s Guests, Ambassadors,
    officers and servants.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Knight Marshal was Judge in all cases in which a servant of the
    King was concerned: he was also one of the Judges in the Court of the
    Marshalsea. He had six Provost Marshals or Vergers in scarlet coats to
    wait upon him.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Servants in ordinary were the Gentlemen of the Bedchamber, and
    the Groom of the Stole, the Vice-Chamberlain, the Keeper of the Privy
    Purse, the Treasurer of the Chamber, the Master of the Robes, the
    twelve Grooms of the Bedchamber, the six Pages of the Bedchamber, the
    four Gentlemen Ushers of the Privy Chamber, the forty-eight Gentlemen
    of the Privy Chamber, the six Grooms of the Privy Chamber, the Library
    Keeper, Black Rod, the eight Gentlemen Ushers of the Presence Chamber,
    the fourteen Grooms of the Great Chamber, six gentlemen waiters, four
    cupbearers, four carvers, four servers, four esquires of the Body, the
    eight servers of the Chamber, the Groom Porter, sixteen serjeants at
    arms, four other serjeants at arms who attended on the Speaker and on
    the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. There were four Physicians in Ordinary,
    a Master and Treasurer of the Jewel House, three Yeomen of the Jewel
    House, a Master of the Ceremonies with an assistant and a marshal;
    three Kings at Arms, six Heralds, and four Poursuivants at Arms; a
    Geographer, a Historiographer, a Hydrographer, a Cosmographer, a Poet
    Laureate, and a Notary.
  </p>

  <p>
    These were the Officers of the Wardrobe: the great Wardrobe, the
    standing wardrobes at Hampton, Windsor, and other places, and the
    Removing Wardrobe which was carried about with the King. For the
    wardrobes were one Yeoman, two Grooms, and three Pages.
  </p>

  <p>
    For the Office of Tents and Pavilions were two Masters, four Yeomen,
    one Groom, one Clerk Comptroller and one Clerk of the Tents. The Master
    of the Revels ordered the plays and masques, etc. He had one Yeoman
    and one Groom. Attached to the Master of the Robes were workmen,
    each in his own craft. The Royal Falconer had thirty-three officers
    under him. The Master of Buckhounds had thirty-four assistants: the
    Master of the Otter hounds had five under him. So had the Master
    of the Harriers. The Master of the Ordnance had a Lieutenant, a
    master Armourer, and seventeen under officers. There were forty-two
    messengers of the Chamber. There were sixty-four Musicians in ordinary;
    fifteen trumpeters and kettle drummers; seven drummers and fifes; two
    Apothecaries; two Chyrurgeons; two Barbers; three Printers; one Printer
    of Oriental tongues. There were bookseller, stationer, bookbinder,
    silkman, woollen draper, postmaster, and a Master of Cock-fighting.
  </p>

    Privy Lodging, two Gentlemen, and two Yeomen of the Bows; one Cross-bow
    maker; one Fletcher; one Cormorant keeper; one Hand-gun maker; one

    one Combmaker, one Serjeant Painter, one Painter, one Limner, one
    Picture-Drawer, one Silver-Smith, one Goldsmith, one Jeweller, one

    bears and Bulls, one Master, one Serjeant, one Yeoman. Two Operators
    for the Teeth. Two coffer-bearers for the Back-stairs, one Yeoman of
    the Leash, fifty-five Watermen. Upholsterer, Letter Carrier, Foreign
    Post, Coffee Maker, of each one.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ten Officers belonging to Gardens, Bowling-Greens, Tennis-Court,
    Pall-Mall, Keeper of the Theatre at Whitehall. Cutler, Spurrier,
    Girdler, Corn-Cutter, Button-maker, Embosser, Enameler, of each one.
    Writer, Flourisher, and Embellisher, Scenographer, or Designer of
    Prospects, Letter-Founder, of each one. Comedians, Seventeen Men, and
    Eight Women, Actors.
  </p>

    under the Lord Chamberlain to serve his Majesty upon occasion.
  </p>

  <p>
    As to the Officers under the Master of the Horse, there are Twelve
    Querries so called of the French Escayer, derived from Escury, a
    Stable. Their office is to attend the King on Hunting or Progress, or
    on any occasion of Riding Abroad, to help His Majesty up and down from
    his Horse, etc. Four of these are called Querries of the Crown-Stable,
    and the others are called Querries of the Hunting-Stable. The Fee to
    each of these is only £20 yearly, according to the Ancient Custom; but
    they have allowance for Diet, to each £100 yearly, besides Lodgings,
    and two Horse-Liveries.
  </p>

  <p>

    Liveries, to run by the King’s Horse. All these Places are in the Gift
    of the Masters of the Horse.
  </p>

  <p>
    There is besides these an antient Officer, called Clerk of the Market,
    who within the Verge of the King’s household, is to keep a Standard
    of all Weights and Measures, and to burn all that are false. From the
    Pattern of this Standard, all the Weights and Measures of the Kingdom
    are to be taken.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are divers other considerable Officers, not Subordinate to the
    Three Great Officers, as the Master of the Great Wardrobe, Post-Master,
    Master of the Ordinance, Warden of the Mint, etc.
  </p>

  <p>
    Upon the King are also attending in his Court the Lords of the Privy
    Council, Secretaries of State, the Judges, the College of Civilians,
    the King’s Council at Law, the King’s Serjeants at Law, the Masters of
    Requests, Clerks of the Signet, Clerks of the Council, Keeper of the
    Paper-Office, or Papers of State, etc.
  </p>

  <p>
    There is always a Military Force to preserve the King’s Person, which
    are His Guards of Horse and Foot. The Guards of Horse are in Number
    600 Men, well armed and equipped; who are generally Young Gentlemen
    of considerable Families, who are there made fit for Military
    Commands. They are divided into Three Troops, viz.: the King’s Troop,
    distinguished by their Blew Ribbons and Carbine Belts, their Red
    Hooses, and Houlster-Caps, Embroidered with His Majesties Cypher and
    Crown. The Queen’s Troops by Green Ribbons, Carbine Belts, covered
    with Green Velvet, and Gold Lace, also Green Hooses and Houlster Caps,
    Embroidered with the same Cypher and Crown. And the Duke’s Troop by
    Yellow Ribbons, and Carbine Belts, and Yellow Hooses, Embroidered as
    the others. In which Troops, are 200 Gentlemen, besides Officers. Each
    of these Three Troops is divided into Four Squadrons or Divisions, two
    of which consisting of one hundred Gentlemen, and Commanded by one
    Principal Commissioned Officer, two Brigadiers, and two Sub-Brigadiers,
    with two Trumpets mount the Guards one day in six, and are Relieved
    in their turns. Their Duty is always by Parties from the Guard, to
    attend the Person of the King, the Queen, the Duke, and the Duchess,
    wheresoever they go near home, but if out of town, they are attended by
    Detachments of the said Three Troops.
  </p>

  <p>
    Besides these, there is a more strict Duty and Attendance Weekly on
    the King’s Person on Foot, wheresoever he walks, from His Rising to
    His going to Bed, by one of the Three Captains, who always waits
    immediately next the King’s own Person, before all others, carrying
    in his hand an Ebony-staff or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>
    Truncheon, with a Gold head, Engraved
    with His Majesty’s Cypher and Crown. Near him also attends a Principal
    Commissioned Officer, with an Ebony-staff, and Silver head, who is
    ready to Relieve the Captain on occasion; and at the same time also,
    two Brigadiers, having also Ebony-staves, headed with Ivory, and
    Engraven as the others.
  </p>

  <p>
    There is added a Troop of Grenadiers to each Troop of Guards, one
    Division of which mounts with a Division of the Troop to which they
    belong; they never go out on small Parties from the Guard, only
    perform Centry-Duty on Foot, and attend the King also on Foot when
    he walks abroad, but always March with great Detachments. The King’s
    Troop consists of a Captain, two Lieutenants, three Serjeants, three
    Corporals, two Drums, two Hautbois, and eighty private Souldiers
    mounted. The Queens Troop, of a Captain, two Lieutenants, two
    Serjeants, two Corporals, two Hautbois, and sixty private Souldiers
    mounted. The Dukes Troop consists of the like number with the Queens.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Captains of His Majesties Guards always Command as Eldest Colonels
    of Horse; the Lieutenants as Eldest Lieutenant-Colonels of Horse; the
    Cornets and Guidons, as Eldest Majors of Horse; the Quartermasters, as
    Youngest Captains of Horse; the Brigadiers as Eldest Lieutenants of
    Horse; and amongst themselves every Officer, according to the Date of
    His Commission, takes precedency, when on Detachments, but not when
    the Three Troops march with their Colours, for then the Officer of the
    Eldest Troop, commands those of equal Rank with him in the others,
    though their Commission be of Elder Date.
  </p>

  <p>
    Next immediately after the Three Troops of Guards, his Majestys
    Regiment of Horse, Commanded by the Earl of Oxford takes place, and the
    Colonel of it is to have precedency, after the Captains of the Guards,
    and before all other Colonels of Horse, whatsoever change may be of the
    Colonel; and all the Officers thereof, in their proper Degree, are to
    take place according to the Dates of their Commissions. As to the Foot,
    the King’s Regiment, Commanded by the Honorable Colonel John Russel,
    takes place of all other Regiments, and the Colonel thereof is always
    to precede as the first Colonel. The Colestream Regiment, Commanded by
    the Earl of Craven, takes the next; the Duke of Yorks Regiment next,
    then his Majestys Holland Regiment, Commanded by the Earl of Mulgrave,
    and all other Colonels, according to the Dates of their Commissions.
    All other Regiments of Horse and Foot, not of the Guards, take place
    according to their Respective Seniority, from the time they were first
    Raised, and no Regiment loses its precedency by the Death of its
    Colonel.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the Kings House, there is a guard for his Person, both above and
    below stairs. In the Presence Chamber, the Band of Gentlemen Pensioners
    wait, instituted by King Henry the VII., and chosen out of the best
    and antientest Families in England, to be a Guard to His Majesties
    Person, and also to be a Nursery to breed up hopeful Gentlemen, and fit
    them for Employments, Civil and Military, as well abroad as at home;
    as Deputies of Ireland, Embassadors in Foreign Parts, Counsellors of
    State, Captains of the Guard, Governors of Places, Commanders in the
    Wars, both by Sea and Land, of all which these have been Examples.
    They are to attend the King’s Person to and from His Chappel, only as
    far as the Privy Chamber: also in all other Solemnity, as Coronations,
    publick Audience of Embassadors, etc. They are 40 in number, over whom
    there is a Captain, usually some Peer of the Realm, a Lieutenant, a
    Standard-Bearer, and a Clerk of the Check. They wait half at a time
    quarterly. Those in quarter wait daily five at a time upon the King in
    the House, and when he walks abroad. Upon extraordinary occasions, all
    of them are Summoned. Their ordinary Arms are Gilt Pole-Axes. Their
    Arms on Horse-back in time of War, are Cuirassiers Arms, with Sword and
    Pistol. These are only under their own Officers, and are always Sworn
    by the Clerk of the Check, who is to take notice of such as are absent
    when they should be upon their duty. Their Standard in time of war, is
    a Cross Gules in a Field Argent, also 4 bends.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the first Room above Stairs, called the Guard-Chamber, attend the
    Yeomen of the Guard of His Majesties body; whereof there were wont to
    be 250 Men of the best quality under Gentry, and of larger Stature than
    ordinary (for every one was to be Six foot high) there are at present
    100 Yeomen in dayly waiting, and 70 more not in waiting, and as any of
    the 100 die, his place is filled up out of the 70. These wear Scarlet
    Coats Down to the Knee and Scarlet Breeches, both richly guarded
    with black Velvet, and rich Badges upon their Coats both before and
    behind, moreover, black Velvet round broad Crown’d Caps, with Ribbons
    of the King’s Colour; one half of them of late bear in their hands
    Harquebuzes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
    and the other half Partizans, with large Swords by their
    Sides; they have Wages and Diet allowed them. Their office is to wait
    upon the King in His standing Houses, 40 by Day, and 20 to Watch by
    Night; about the City to wait upon the King’s Person abroad by Water or
    Land.
  </p>

  <p>
    The King’s Palace Royal (<i xml:lang="la">ratione Regiæ dignitatis</i>) is exempted from
    all Jurisdiction of any Court, Civil or Ecclesiastick, but only to the
    Lord Steward, and in his absence, to the Treasurer and Comptroller
    of the King’s Household, with the Steward of the Marshalsea, who by
    vertue of their Office, without Commission, may Hear and Determin all
    Treasons, Fellonies, Breaches of the Peace, Committed within the King’s
    Court or Palace. The Orders and Rules for the Demeanor of all Officers
    and Servants are hung upon Tables in several Rooms at the Court, and
    Signed with the King’s own hand, worthy to be read of all Strangers.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Court or House where the King resides is accounted a Place so
    Sacred, that if any man presume to strike another there, and only draw
    blood, his Right Hand shall be cut off, and he committed to perpetual
    Imprisonment, and Fined. All occasions of striking are also there
    forbidden.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Court of England for Magnificence, Order, Number and Quality of
    Officers, rich Furniture, entertainment and Civility to Strangers, and
    for plentiful Tables, might compare with the best in Christendom, and
    far excels most Courts abroad. It hath for a long time been a Pattern
    of Hospitality and Charity to the Nobility and Gentry of England. All
    Noblemen or Gentlemen, Subjects or Strangers, were freely entertained
    at the plentiful Tables of His Majesties Officers. Divers Dishes were
    provided every day extraordinary for the King’s Honour. Two hundred and
    forty Gallons of Beer a day were allowed at the Butters-Bar for the
    Poor, besides all the Broken Meat, Bread, etc., gathered into Baskets,
    and given to the Poor, at the Court-Gates, by Two Grooms and Two Yeomen
    of the Almonry, who have salaries of His Majesty for that Service. The
    Lord Almoner hath the Privilege to give the King’s Dish to whatsoever
    Poor Man he pleases; that is, the first Dish at Dinner which is set
    upon the King’s Table, or in stead thereof, fourpence a day (which
    anciently was equivalent to four shillings now); next he distributes
    to 24 poor men, named by the Parishioners of the Parish adjacent to
    the King’s Place of Residence, to each of them fourpence in money, a
    Twopenny Loaf, and a Gallon of Beer, or instead thereof three pence
    in Money, equally to be divided among them every Morning at seven of
    the Clock at the Court-Gate. The Sub-Almoner is to Scatter new-coined
    Two-pences in the Towns and Places where the King passes through in
    his Progresses, to a certain Sum by the Year. Besides, there are many
    poor Pensioners, either because so old that they are unfit for Service,
    or the Widows of any of the King’s Servants that dyed poor, who have
    a Competency duly paid them: Besides, there are distributed among the
    poor the larger Offerings which the King gives in Collar Days.

    The magnificent and abundant plenty of the King’s Tables hath caused
    amazement in Foreigners. In the Reign of King Charles I. there were
    daily in his Court 86 Tables well furnished each Meal, whereof the
    King’s Tables had 28 Dishes, the Queen’s 24, 4 other Tables 16 Dishes
    each, 3 other 10 Dishes, 12 other 7 Dishes, 17 other 5 Dishes, 3 other
    4, 32 had 3, and 13 had each 2; in all about 500 Dishes each Meal, with
    Bread, Beer, Wine, and all other things necessary. There was spent
    yearly in the King’s House of gross Meat 1500 Oxen, 7000 Sheep, 1200
    Veals, 300 Porkers, 400 Sturks or young Beefs, 6800 Lambs, 300 Flitches
    of Bacon, and 26 Boars. Also 140 dozen of Geese, 250 dozen of Capons,
    470 dozen of Hens, 750 dozen of Pullets, 1470 dozen of Chickens, for
    Bread 36,400 Bushels of Wheat, and for Drink, 600 Tun of Wine and 1700
    Tun of Beer. Moreover, of Butter 46,640, together with the Fish and
    Fowl, Venison, Fruit, Spice, proportionably. This prodigious plenty in
    the King’s Court caused Foreigners to put a higher value upon the King,
    and was much for the Honour of the Kingdom. The King’s Servants being
    Men of Quality, by His Majesty’s special Order went to Westminster
    Hall in Term Time, to invite Gentlemen to eat of the King’s Acates or
    Viands, and in Parliament-time, to invite the Parliament-men thereto.
  </p>

  <p>
    On the Thursday before Easter, called Maundy Thursday, the King, or
    his Lord Almoner, was wont to wash the Feet of as many poor Men as
    His Majesty had reigned years, and then to wipe them with a Towel
    (according to the Pattern of our Saviour), and then to give every
    one of them two Yards and a half of Woollen Cloth, to make a Suit of
    cloaths; also Linnen Cloth for two Shirts, and a pair of Stockings,
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
    and a pair of Shoes, three Dishes of Fish in Wooden Platters, one of
    Salt Salmon, a second of Green Fish or Cod, a third of Pickle-Herrings,
    Red Herrings, and Red Sprats; a Gallon of Beer, a Quart Pottle of Wine,
    and four six-penny Loaves of Bread, also a Red-Leather-Purse with as
    many single Pence as the King is years old, and in face another Purse
    as many Shillings as the King hath reigned Years. The Queen doth the
    like to divers poor Women.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Form of Government is by the wisdom of many Ages, so contrived and
    regulated, that it is almost impossible to mend it. The Account (which
    is of so many Natures, and is therefore very difficult, must pass
    through many hands, and is therefore very exact) is so wisely contrived
    and methodized, that without the Combination of everyone of these
    following Officers, viz. the Cofferer, a Clerk of the Green-Cloth, a
    Clerk-Comptroller, a Clerk of the Kitchen, of the Spicery or Avery, or
    a particular Clerk, together with the conjunction of a Purveyor and
    Waiter in the Office, it is impossible to defraud the King of a Loaf of
    Bread, of a Pint of Wine, a Quart of Beer, or Joint of Meat, or Money,
    or anything else.”

  <p>The total of the New Buildings from 1656 to 1677 is about Ten Thousand.</p>

  <p>The Total from 1620 to 1656 was about Seven Thousand Five Hundred.</p>

  <p>
    Their value at one year’s rent about Seventy Thousand Pound if it had
    been collected.
  </p>

  <p>
    Though the particular makes the number but 6646, and the sum but 57,606
    Pounds, some Parishes being wanting.
  </p>

  <p>
    As there have been great mistakes about the Damage and Nuisance by the
    increase of New Buildings in the Suburbs: so by this we may see the
    mistake to be as great about their number and value; some reporting
    their number to be Twenty Thousand; others Thirty Thousand: though it
    is very plain to any man that considers that their number cannot be
    much above Ten Thousand, for that the Total of all the Houses, both
    New and Old, both in the City and in the Bills of Mortality, are not
    Threescore Thousand.
  </p>

  <p>
    That this is true, and that the number from 1656 to 1677 cannot much
    exceed Ten Thousand, will appear by comparing the Increase of the
    Burials from 1620 to 1656 with the particular of the New Houses built
    within that time....
  </p>

  <p>
    The Medium is the Increase of two Burials for every five houses that
    were built, so that the Increase of Two Thousand Five Hundred Houses
    raises the Burials One Thousand.
  </p>

  <p>
    And If we examine the Increase of the Burials from 1656 to 1677 we
    shall find them to be about Four Thousand, which being but a fourth
    more than were from 1620 to 1656. The new houses since that time cannot
    be reckoned above a Fourth, which makes the Total about Ten Thousand.
  </p>

  <p>
    And this way of calculation, though it may not exactly discover the
    particular number of Houses, yet it is sufficient to prove there can
    be no mistake of Thousands in the Account: for that the Inhabitants of
    two or three Thousand Houses would have added a visible Increase to the
    Burials.
  </p>

  <p>
    And to fully justify this computation, it agrees very well with the
    calculation made by the Ingenious Mr. Grant both of the Total number of
    the Inhabitants within the Bills of Mortality, and his probable guess
    that about three in one hundred die, allowing twelve Inhabitants to
    every House, one with another, which no man I suppose will dispute.
  </p>

  <p>
    This will apparently confute that wild conjecture of some, who report
    that there is Three Thousand Five Hundred New Houses in St. Martin’s
    Parish, when the Burials of that Parish are not above Eighteen Hundred
    in a year: so that the Total of New and Old in that Parish cannot be
    above Four Thousand Five Hundred, and therefore it is probable that the
    Account of 1780 now given in is very true.
  </p>

  <p>
    The conjectures of many concerning the value of these Houses, that they
    will make twenty pounds a year one with another, and raise two or three
    Thousand pounds, are as false as about the number of them.
  </p>

  <p>
    For Ten Thousand Houses will not raise about fifty Thousand pounds, it
    being the half years value at ten pounds a year one with another, which
    is the most they can be reckoned at.
  </p>

  <p>
    As will plainly appear from the account of the value of those seven
    thousand five hundred Houses, which did not amount to Seventy Thousand
    pound at a whole year’s value, as appears by the Duplicate in the
    Exchequer, they are making one with another ten pound a year.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now the great houses in the Piazza, Lincolns-Inn-Fields, and
    Queen-street, were equal in value to these twenty-two Houses in St.
    James Square, or Bloomsbury Square, or other places: and are more in
    number of that sort of Houses than have been built since.
  </p>

  <p>
    Besides the middle sort of Houses in the streets of Covent-Garden,
    Long-Acre, Clare-Market, Old-Southampton Buildings, and other
    places have equall’d both the number and value of Leicester-Fields,
    Bloomesbury, York-Buildings, Essex-Buildings and the rest. And the
    number of the small houses at four and five pounds per Annum since 1656
    are much greater.
  </p>

  <p>
    So that upon enquiry it is plain that the Houses that were built before
    1656 were equal in value to what have been built since. And therefore
    it is not probable that a Tax upon the New foundation can raise above
    Fifty Thousand Pound, which considered with the charge of collecting
    it, and the loss of His Majesties customes upon Timber, Boards,
    Wainscot and Iron, being not less than Ten Thousand pound per annum,
    which will be occasioned by the discouraging of Building will not bring
    in Thirty Thousand pounds clear into the Exchequer, if it were possible
    to make the Law so that all might be collected.
  </p>

  <p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span></p>

  <p>
    But not to mention how hard the purchasers of New Houses will believe
    such a Law to be, having paid a valuable consideration for them and
    offended no Law.
  </p>

  <p>
    Nor how severe the Workmen Builders will think they are dealt with, to
    be punished for exercising their lawful Trades.
  </p>

  <p>
    Nor how partial it will be to those that build since 1656, that have
    already paid a year’s value. Not to mention what the owners of the
    great houses that have been altered think, not being allowed the £500 a
    year which their Houses yielded before: since they pay for improvement
    by the building of their Gardens.
  </p>

  <p>
    Nor what is general all those sufferers will think, who believe they
    have done good service to the nation by Building. The Law will have
    this peculiar disadvantage, it will be impossible so to word it, or to
    comprize all men’s interests, so as to raise that money as shall be
    designed by it. For after the Commissioners of Oliver’s Act had set
    four years, they did pay in Twenty Thousand pounds into the Exchequer
    of the £70,000 that was returned upon the Duplicates.”

    </h3>
  </div>

  <p class="noindent">
    “<span class="smcap">The</span> garden played a large part in the recreation of the citizens. A
    contemporary account of the principal London gardens is here subjoined:—
  </p>

  <p>
    <i>Chelsea Physick Garden</i> has a great variety of plants both in and out
    of greenhouses. Their perennial green hedges and rows of different
    coloured herbs are very pretty, and so are their banks set with shades
    of herbs in the Irish stitchway, but many plants of the garden were
    not in so good order as might be expected, and as would have been
    answerable to other things in it. After I had been there, I heard that
    Mr. Watts, the keeper of it, was blamed for his neglect and that he
    would be removed.
  </p>

  <p>
    <i>My Lord Ranelagh’s Garden</i> being but lately made, the plants are
    but small, but the plants, borders, and walks are curiously kept,
    and elegantly designed, having the advantage of opening into Chelsea
    college walks. The kitchen garden there lies very fine, with walks and
    seats, one of which, being large and covered, was then under the hands
    of a curious painter. The house there is very fine within, all the
    rooms being wainscoted with Norway oak, and all the chimneys adorned
    with carving, as in the council-chamber in Chelsea College.
  </p>

  <p>
    <i>Arlington Garden</i>, being now in the hands of my lord of Devonshire,
    is a fair place, with good walks, both airy and shady. There are
    six of the greatest earthern pots that are anywhere else, being at
    least two feet over within the edge: but they stand abroad, and have
    nothing in them but the tree holy-oke, an indifferent plant, which
    grows well enough in the ground. Their greenhouse is very well, and
    their green-yard excels: but their greens are not so bright and clean
    as farther off in the country, as if they suffered something from the
    smutty air of the town.
  </p>

  <p>
    <i>Kensington Gardens</i> are not great nor abounding with fine plants. The
    orange, lemon, myrtles, and what other trees they had there in summer,
    were all removed to Mr. London’s and Mr. Wise’s greenhouse at Brompton
    Park, a little mile from them. But the walks and grass laid very fine,
    and they were digging up a flat of four or five acres to enlarge their
    garden.
  </p>

  <p>
    <i>The Queen Dowager’s Garden</i>, at Hammersmith, has a good greenhouse,
    with a high erected front to the South, whence the roof falls backward.
    The house is well stored with greens of common kinds: but the Queen
    not being for curious plants or flowers, they want of the most curious
    sorts of greens, and in the garden there is little of value but wall
    trees: though the gardener there, Monsieur Hermon Van Guine, is a man
    of great skill and industry, having raised great numbers of orange and
    lemon trees by inoculation, with myrtles, Roman bayes, and other greens
    of pretty shapes which he has to dispose of.
  </p>

  <p>
    <i>Sir Thomas Cooke’s Garden</i> at Hackney is very large, and not so fine
    at present, because of his intending to be at three thousand pounds
    charge with it this next summer, as his gardener said. There are two
    greenhouses in it, but the greens are not extraordinary, for one of the
    roofs, being made a receptacle for water, overcharged with weight, fell
    down last year upon the greens, and made a great destruction among the
    trees and pots. In one part of it is a warren, containing about two
    acres, very full of coneys, though there was but a couple put in a few
    years since. There is a pond or a mote round about them, and on the
    <span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
    outside of that a brick wall four feet high, both which I think will
    not keep them within their compass. There is a large fish-pond lying on
    the South to a brick wall, which is finely clad with philaria. Water
    brought from far in pipes furnishes his several ponds as they want it.
  </p>

  <p>
    <i>The Archbishop of Canterbury’s Garden</i> at Lambeth has little in it
    but walks, the late archbishop not delighting in one, but they are
    now making them better: and they have already made a greenhouse, one
    of the finest and costliest about the town. It is of three rooms, the
    middle having a stove under it: the forsides of the room are almost
    all glass, the roof covered with lead, the whole part (to adorn the
    building) rising gavel wise higher than the rest: but it is placed so
    near Lambeth church that the sun shines most on it in winter after
    eleven o’clock: a fault owned by the gardener, but not thought on by
    the contrivers. Most of the greens are oranges and lemons, which have
    very large ripe fruit on them.
  </p>

  <p>
    Mr. Evelyn had a pleasant villa at Deptford, a fine garden for walks
    and hedges (especially his holly on which he writes of in his <cite>Sylva</cite>)
    and a pretty little greenhouse with an indifferent stock in it. In this
    garden he has four large round philarias, smooth clipped, raised on
    a single stalk from the ground, a fashion now much used. Part of his
    garden is very woody and shady for walking: but his garden not being
    walled, has little of the best fruits.”

  <div class="center small mt3 mb2">
    THE FOLLOWING EXPLANATIONS ARE EXTRACTED FROM OGILBY’S KEY TO THE MAP
    IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM
  </div>

  <p>
    We Proceed to the Explanation of the Map, containing 25 Wards, 122
    Parishes and Liberties, and therein 189 Streets, 153 Lanes, 522 Alleys,
    458 Courts, and 210 Yards bearing Name.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Broad Black Line is the City Wall. The Line of the Freedom is a
    Chain. The Division of the Wards, thus oooo. The Parishes, Liberties,
    and Precincts by a Prick-line, ... Each Ward and Parish is known by
    the Letters and Figures Distributed within their Bounds, which are
    placed in the Tables before their Names.... The Wards by Capitals
    without Figures. The Parishes, &amp;c., by Numbers without Letters. The
    Great Letters with Numbers refer to Halls, Great Buildings, and Inns.
    The Small Letters to Courts, Yards, and Alleys, every Letter being
    repeated 99 times, and sprinkled in the Space of 5 Inches, running
    through the Map, from the Left Hand to the Right, &amp;c. Churches and
    Eminent Buildings are double Hatch’d, Streets, Lanes, Alleys, Courts,
    and Yards, are left White. Gardens, &amp;c. faintly Prick’d. Where the
    Space admits the Name of the Place is in Words at length, but where
    there is not room, a Letter and Figure refers you to the Table in
    which the Streets are Alphabetically dispos’d, and in every Street the
    Churches and Halls, Places of Note, and Inns, with the Courts, Yards,
    and Alleys, are named; then the Lanes in that Street, and the Churches,
    &amp;c. as aforesaid, in each Lane.

    exasperate the City; and I have good ground of hopes from them,
    that they will Levy the Assess; They desiring onely first to meet
    in Common-Council, which they intend to do to morrow morning.
    It seems probable to me, that they will yeild obedience to your
    Commands, and be brought to a friendly Complyance with you; for
    which reason I have suspended the execution of your Commands
    touching the Gates and Portcullises, till I know your further
    pleasure therein, which I desire I may by this Bearer; I shall
    onely desire, that (so your Commands may be answered with due
    obedience) such tenderness may be used towards them, as may gain
    their affections; They desired the Restauration of those Members
    of their Common-Council that are secured, which desires of theirs
    I shall onely commend to your grave Consideration, to do therein
    as you shall think most expedient, and, in attendance upon your

  <p class="noindent">
    <i>The Red Bull Playhouse stood on a plot of ground lately called “Red
    Bull Yard” near the upper end of S<sup>t</sup>. John’s Street Clerkenwell; and
    is traditionally said to have been the Theatre at which Shakespeare
    first held a gentleman’s horses. In the civil wars it became highly
    celebrated for the representations of Drolls, to a collection of which
    pieces published by Frauncis Kirkman in 1672, this view of it forms a
    frontispiece. The figures brought together on the stage are intended
    as portraits of the leading actors in each Droll. The one playing
    Simpleton is Robert Cox, then a great favourite, of whom the publisher
    thus speaks in his preface. “I have seen the Red Bull Playhouse which
    was a large one, so full that as many went back for want of room as had
    entred. Robert Cox, a principal actor and contriver of these pieces,
    how have I heard him cryed up for his John Swabber, and Simpleton,
    the Smith. In which latter, he being to appear with a large piece of
    Bread &amp; Butter, on the stage I have frequently known some of the female
    spectators to long for it”. The above print may be regarded not only as
    highly curious for the place it represents, but as a unique specimen of
    the interior economy of our antient English Theatres.</i>

Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
